- Not sure what to do about my recordings with YouTube, I think it should be a new channel. But attached to my personal account? Unsure. It could also be with my Instawiki, now SirFrancistowne Google account, but then I wouldn't have Premium which is kind of annoying.
- Hmm, need a thumb drive that's 32GB. I could just use one I have (such as the BIOS one), and then order some extra ones. Yea, we'll do that.
- Lol, you can use the A7IV as a webcam with a USB cable. Can you imagine the mount???
- The funny thing is that if I start regularly recording video, I'm going to need to expand the NAS lmao.
- Considering this machine is really decked out, I'm not sure what I'd do with a second NAS build if I find I need even more space. Maybe just a JBOD? Not sure. At least if we do get a machine for Rembrandt, we'd move its data to it.
- The RAM has been returned to Newegg, hopefully it ships out again shortly.
- Alright, so pulled my recordings from iCloud onto Prophet and deleted them from iCloud. Next time I'll try direct from Quicktime.
  - Figure I'll upload those to Twitter and eventually YouTube. Think I want to figure that out.
- Oh this is cool: https://www.apple.com/ca/shop/product/HQ652ZM/A/belkin-iphone-mount-magsafe-compatible-for-mac-desktops
  - Belkin MagSafe mount for Apple Desktop monitors, seems to be a Pro Display in the image.
  - And compatible with typical tripod threads!
- Dope, you can totally record from the Mac with Quicktime. Open Quicktime, then File > New Movie Recording, and you can choose the iPhone as a source for audio and video. Nice thing is I can turn around and see if it's still recording.
- So, I need to clean off the desk first. But I think I'm gonna do some VR before all of that.
- Played Beat Saber on the Quest 3 today and hit a new record on the Weeknd song I've been playing. I'm now pretty close to the top 500 score worldwide. I think practicing with the Quest 2 and Pro controllers has helped since the Quest 3's Plus controllers feel so light and airy in comparison. Quest 3 is so CLEAR. Although did start to fog up a bit near the end.
- Have an hour until my meeting with RBC. While that'll be in the way of recording, I can at least clear the desk off.
- Also need to update Prophet to 14.1 (already did Oblivion).
- Oh, gonna go with Aegis for the NAS's name.
- Hey the keyboards are here! Those will be fun to do unboxings for.
- I think the next thing I need to do is unbox the 980 Pros, install them, and make sure they work.
- The HBA is now in Toronto. Wonder if it'll get here before the RAM lol.
- Set up a YouTube channel for SirFrancisTowne. Verified the number, and tried a livestream (so that the 24hr counter starts).
  - Figure this is where I'll add the videos, although, I'll probably upload them directly to Twitter too (because of the alGoRiThM).
- I should buy some more double sided tape, in part to mount the AIO of the GPU, in part to mount the fucking power bar again.
- Okay, met with Wes/Sheri at RBC. They're going to increase the credit limit on the card to something like $40K, which is a lot nicer in terms of headroom. And then set up another LOC for $40K. Just said it was because I wanted to allocate them to different things.
- Well, now that that's done. Think I might just go and walk the dog. Get that out of the way.
- Done with lunch. Installed Unraid onto the USB Stick. Going to meditate, then time to get back to recording!
- Ok, the recording via Quicktime is pretty good. Only thing is the Mac went to sleep after a bit, but it was still recording. Guess I need amphetamine.
- Oh noooo, the 3090Ti covers the final slot!
- Ended up ordering a M.2 to PCIe riser card. Thing is, this'll probably actually be better. I've swapped the drive in the top position, and that means there'll be a lot of room there for the HBA. It's not like the HBA needs to have a PCIe slot anyways. And, that M.2 slot is PCIe 5.0 x4, so it's actually better than using the 16x slot at the bottom since that'd only be 2x. So all's well that end's well I guess. It's prime, so should be here tomorrow, likely before the HBA itself.
  - Also, I was right that the AIO will be really tight. The tubes I think will have enough space to fold over without completely pinching, but it'll still be tight. At least it should close. Still not sure where I'll but the heatsink itself... Although, hilariously, I could actually put it outside the case...
- Replacement RAM order has been created.
- Alright, should clear the desk and do the unboxings for the keyboards. Should also edit my shit tonight.
- Oh, kind of forgot about how much battery recording would use. Phone is at 35%, need to let it charge for a bit.
- Was going to bring everything downstairs, but really that should be the last thing I do. I should get the drives installed, the GPU, and unraid all up here where I can easily record it. Then, the only time I need to record downstairs is when I'm installing it in the rack, and later when I need to install the HBA and new memory.
- Oh shit, it's halloween tonight. And Sarah has a headache so will probably be just me. Means I need to work out like... now. Before all of the trick or treaters arrive.
  - Probably should just do arms. Or... legs. I forget which one is faster. Might be legs actually.
- And worked out. Feels good! The oven is preheating, just waiting on trick-or-treaters now. Don't see anyone out yet.

* October 30th, 2023
- WTF, my RAM is actually returning to the shipping location... I feel like they fucked up the information or something. It's returning to Ontario, CA.
  - Contacted them and they'll ship it back to me... again.
- Right, time to reach out to Wes Cutting.
  - Emailed!
- Also reached out to Staples to figure out what's up with that stupid chair mat. They'll follow up with me later.
- I'm feeling really weird right now. I don't know what it is. I'm not sure if it's due to my gut. Or that I'm on medication today and I'm just feeling that. Or if it's anticipation of the case. Or having to deal with the cat litter. Or what...
- I should do the cat litter, then do some beat saber.
  - Cat litter done. Time for Beat Saber!
- Beat Saber was good. It's nice to move my body so much in the morning. Though I'm getting a bit bored with it, I think I should switch up the game I play again.
- I was not prepared for how much emotional regulation I'd be responsible for with Sarah being pregnant. She's really uncomfortable and nauseous all the time now, and so she's essentially always miserable by default. And she has a headache and can't exactly use anything to deal with it. So I have to do my best not to take all of that negative energy on myself, and at least try to make her feel better by making her laugh or doing other things like that.
- Something Dan brought up is that I'm in a liminal space right now in that not only has my life as I knew it changed (due to the sale and the move), I know that after the baby arrives my life will be very different too, and so I'm in this transitionary period and recognize it as such, but I have a hard time knowing what to do about it. I guess it actually is somewhat like summer vacation. You know you'll be going back to school at some point, but you're just /free/ at the moment.
  - And I think that makes it a bit hard to know what to do at the moment. I have all these little projects on the go, but they aren't really cohesive, or aligned with some longer term goal.
  - But I don't know what that longer term goal would /be/.
- Going to shower, but specifically because I need to shave.
- Case is here! Came just as I was drying off from the shower. Thankfully they just left it at the door.
- I should put in my order with Trains and Such. Since they do their orders on Tuesdays.
- Ah, I know why I'm not opening that case right now. It's because we're expecting a delivery from Crate & Barrel and I don't want to be interrupted while filming.
- Something else on my mind is, do I need an nVidia Shield if the NAS is in the same room as the home theater equipment? I could literally run an HDMI cable up and over the ceiling and connect directly.
- Interesting thought from Introspect: "Step outside yourself and evaluate the relationship you have with yourself"
  - "Specifically, consider it as if it were a relationship between strangers, of friends, or a parent and a child, or a manager and their employee. If you wanna have fun with it, you could even write out a journal entry, in the style of how people write to relationship advice columns about their partners."
  - The parent-child thing I've kind of done before. Talk to my child self as my adult parent self. And it was pretty helpful.
- The next is "Make a list of behaviours that you like and dislike"
  - The funny thing is, the only behaviour I dislike is the beating myself up.
  - And I find myself disliking spending so much time on twitter. The problem isn't twitter, it's that I think I'm looking for connection with people, but I'm not all that great about it.
  - I also dislike getting frustrated with Sarah. I'm not sure where that comes from.
- Occurs to me that one of the things I do like is doing projects that I know I could involve my kids in later. The thing with programming is that it's not exactly conducive to that. But things like building a computer, or playing with trains absolutely are.
- Okay, so the delivery is from 2-4, so I do have a lot of time. Time for some lunch!
- What do I order from Trains and Such? The remote, obvs, but I think I should get some more switches. One option is the Wye switches, but some O36 ones would be good too, maybe a mix of manual/remote?
  - When I go in to pick it up, I'll also pick up more of those 30" tracks as well. They're really convenient.
- What does being true to myself look like?
- Maybe I need to spend more time imagining things. I think I've had a tendency to shoot that down as childlike, but that's actually a skill I need to cultivate to enjoy interacting with my kids! Also, I think that's sort of what's gone from my interactions with computers. I used to just IMAGINE doing stuff with computers, that I kind of do now, but I'm very /serious/ about.
  - And you know, imagination definitely helped me during sex with myself. Hard to open that up with others though. Perhaps that's part of what makes me jealous of people who have sex with lots of people. It's that they've opened themselves up to others in a way that feels foreign and forbidden to me.
- "1) Make a list of all the things you feel regret about, shame about, embarrassed about and so on. This can of course be painful and uncomfortable to do, and you might struggle to get it all out the first time. Still, try. 2) See if there's anything that you can forgive yourself for. Do it. I recommend actually talking to yourself out loud, or writing out loud in your journal. 'Dear Visa. When you were 16, you... I'll admit, I feel some shame and embarrassment about that. That was not cool. Can we do something about it? Can we make amends?' 3) Do it! Say that you are a different person now. Have a little ceremony. Rituals are powerful, even simple and 'trivial' ones! If you have a trusted friend you can talk to about this, do that".
  - Actually, that's a good point. It's not enough that I tell myself that I'm retired now. I should actually have a little celebration of it.
- Why am I so averse to planning travel???
- Omg, I think the reason I beat myself up about being productive is that I don't want to turn out like dad... And you know, I think that goes back to when he talked about Monkey Foot and all that. I was really excited by that idea but it never went anywhere, and I think I held that against him for so long, I saw it as laziness or something on his part. But that's not fair. 1) You never actually expressed your disappointment to dad about that, so how would he know, and 2) Dad was absolutely a very productive person. He ran Alice, daily, for yearssss! I just was too young to recognize that.
  - And the reality is that I'm a lot like Dad. Hating him was just hating me all along.
  - And despite my disagreements with him, Dad was very open about the things he cared about.
- I think I'm most afraid of being lonely, and counter-intuitively I run away from people because I don't want to be abandoned by them, or mocked. I'm so afraid of not fitting in that I don't bother trying to fit in in the first place.
- Okay, lunch done. I think I should try and mount that power bar again now that there's less stuff hanging off of it. Will need to clear the desk off a bit too.
- Let's get the latest BIOS on this flash drive too. Wonder if there's a newer one anyways. Hmm, October 12th. Not sure if I did that one or not. "To support upcoming CPU". Interesting, wonder what it was.
  - Hmmmm, desktop is being weird again. Rebooted to install a driver update then it was showing a green and white light on at the same time. Never seen that before. Now it's stuck on a Red light.
  - Okay well this is fucking bizarre. It booted, then didn't show any video on the integrated or the 4090. Now when I reset it's stuck on REd again, which is CPU...
  - I guess I'll have to clear the CMOS then.
  - Well, may as well just unplug it.
  - Okay something's up with the video card. Fucked drivers??? Very bizarre.
  - Might try updating the BIOS anyways.
  - BIOS updating after removing the 4090. No idea what's happening. Going to try plugging it in again after that's all resolved and the settings are fixed.
  - I'm so confused. I can get into Windows and then the display will work, but it fails by itself. Need to use the iGPU first. It also keeps complaining about the DRAM on boot... maybe try reseating it?
- God dammit. Didn't have enough of the fucking double sided tape again...
- Well, I think it's fine now. At least, it's booting without the iGPU, and it's not giving me memory errors on boot anymore. We'll see if it boots fine again later. Essentially I just swapped the DIMMs around to see if reseating them helped and switched to EXPO II instead of EXPO I. Probably entirely unrelated, but whatever. If this other board is also finicky, I'll know it's just the hardware generally being finicky. If the new one isn't finicky though, it might be worth RMAing to Asus.
- Well, table has arrived too. So I'm free to do the unboxing videos. I think my plan for those is to do each unboxing separately. Then I can do the assembly to POST.
- Before I do that. May as well go and walk the dog. Get that over with.
- Back from walking the dog. God she loves running around in the snow.
- Of course, now I'm sweaty and don't want to do anything on camera now. SMH.
- I still want to listen to the L800s somewhere. Really want to see how that sound stage is.
- Okay, took a picture of everything together. Guess I can start unboxing. Case should probably be first.
- Well that's annoying. Every time I actually start talking about things my phone decides that it's had enough recording. It was telling me that it was out of space, but it isn't... Could try recording 60hz 1080 instead of 4K. Should take those videos out of iCloud though.
- Maybe I should just use Sarah's camera. That or the webcam. It can be mounted to the tripod I think.
- Yeaaaaa, this takes forever to copy over. May as well go with a webcam. Oh, I wonder if I can record directly to the computer with that whole use the iPhone as a webcam thing.
- Looks like you can record directly from Quicktime apparently. Similar thing to scanning a document from Preview.
- And it has overheated. Yay.
- Picked up the SATA-Molex adapters, and went to Ikea to look at chairs for the new dining room table.
- Just got out of the hot tub, first time skinny dipping in it. :)
- Was thinking that I don't need to record in 4K60, that's kind of stupid. I could just do HD60 and that'd be a quarter the size.

* October 29th, 2023
- Going to call Geoff to make the first payment for the down payment on the home theatre. I need to contact RBC this week and ask about a) setting up a line of credit, and b) extending the credit limit on the credit card, $25K is kind of low. Should check my credit score recently.
- Damn, this selfie stick/tripod is pretty cool. Comes with a bluetooth remote that you use as a camera shutter.
- Gonna do ramen for dinner. Fuck ya.
- Did the hot tub this afternoon, so fucking good. Need to clean out the filter.

* October 27th, 2023
- Case rails are in Calgary as of early this morning. Might get those today too! That'd mean I'd just be waiting on the memory and HBA. But otherwise, I'd be able to have everything set up.
- Well Canada Post came and went, didn't see a huge box go into the mailbox though. Not sure how that's supposed to be delivered.
- Oh yea, today I can try out the active straps for the Pro controllers more seriously. I only tried them on yesterday without actually playing with them. Expecting a delivery from Ikea shortly though, and will probably need to help move stuff.
- Yea, nothing in the mailbox. So not sure what's happening with that.
- Ikea stuff is here. Still no sign of the Canada Post drop off. Trying to remember if I've had deliveries from them later in the day or not. Doesn't really matter if it gets here now or later though, I still want that tripod first.
- The keyboards are in Calgary as of 10:30am. Not sure if they'll deliver on the weekend or not though. Either way, I expect them to arrive sooner than Wednesday (which is what they say).
- Alright, time to try out these controllers!
  - Okay, wayyy better. Except just as with the other ones I have a tendency to put them on too tight and I don't notice it until I'm like 15min in and my hands start to hurt. So loosened them a bit for next time.
  - I'm gonna need to try the steam cleaner on that carpet, I sweat so much lol.
  - That's one thing with the Quest 2, it does seem to fog up more often on the lenses. Not sure if that's due to my hair being in, or if the light blocker exacerbates the problem.
- Oof. I'm like $100K down right now. Markets are shit. LOL, it looks like I bought at the top of the market. Ehh.
  - I think I get why people like real estate a bit more. It's less volatile so you can believe your house is priced somewhere above where you bought it. You don't have a real time feed of how you're being fucked.
  - SPY is down 6%, but I'm only down about 3.5-4%. So eh, not bad.
  - I should look at setting up another LoC for personal financing things. I need to pay off the Flexiti account soon, and lord knows how much mark is going to need. It's mostly to finance some stuff over a shorter time frame to spread out the cash impact. I also need it separate since the other LoC is for lending to Mark.
- Wait wtf, the delivery of the case is now saying it's delayed due to extreme weather conditions in Edmonton...
  - God dammit now it says Monday... At least maybe it'll come with the RAM then.
- I now feel like I need to make more money. But not in a sad way. Like, I need to conquer and accumulate more wealth.
  - I think this might be in part due to feeling really good lately. I still have these pangs of bad emotion with work, but it's not as salient. In particular, whereas recently I'd be a bit annoyed when Sarah wanted her good night kiss, yesterday I responded emphatically. And I've just been in a generally good mood, even though I've been falling asleep later than usual. My guess is this is related to doing stuff I really enjoy and I've just been starved of that.
  - I mean, if that's all it takes to feel better, I've clearly been fundamentally ignoring my needs for a long time.
  - And my frustration with not programming or seeing it as tedious is that I'm rebelling against myself.
  - Although come to think of it, Sarah actively encouraging my interest in trains probably helps a lot. It's social validation.
  - Last night I was reading about steam trains and learned that the A4 steam train set the world speed record for steam back in like the 30s and it's been unbroken ever since. And that had me thinking "if I were a billionaire, I'd hire a bunch of engineers to design a modern steam locomotive to break that record using modern metalurgy, etc." On top of that, you'd need track which you'd either need to own, or you'd have to like partner with one of the big railroads.
- Nice, the tripod is out for delivery. Even if the case isn't here, I can still do all of the unboxing of stuff and making sure it posts, etc.
- Learning to share what I'm doing is really important. It's not natural to me, but it's probably the biggest thing I can do to grow. It occurs to me that it was the thing I was the worst at while working, and something I think I lacked as a manager too come to think of it. I think there are many reasons I don't share, but one of them is that I also feel... embarrassed? Like if I share what I've done it'll feel like it wasn't enough, and counter-intuitively the fear is that I'll let people down, so I'd rather just tell them nothing. And it's probably why I wasn't good at asking people what they were up to, due to a sort of empathy and expectation that they'd feel the same way as I do if I asked what they were doing.
  - And somewhere along the line, I picked up this idea that I had to do it all myself. That I couldn't really delegate things.
  - Honestly I just want someone to say that I've done a good job... it just feels like when I do something, I get more things to do or there's something wrong with it.
  - And that's probably why I have a harder time at work than I did at school. At school there's a clear result associated with your effort. At work... it's abstracted away.
  - Like, I have this odd thing where I'd rather do dishes or build furniture because you can see what you've done, but with software? It's just endless stuff to improve. It's never good enough.
  - Why does fixing bugs feel tedious but solving puzzles doesn't? Actually that's not true, I find puzzles to be pretty tedious too lmao. I think it's because once I've figured out the generalized version, I lose interest in the specifics.
- Another thing I was thinking about yesterday is that I'm probably too attached to the idea that I'm a programmer, and that I have to be good at that. But part of that comes down to me holding on to that as a label, and the fear is that if I drop that label, what else do I have? It's like, I'm no longer an entrepreneur/founder, and "programmer" is the only thing I have left, but then I feel like I'm not good at that, and so I'm just miserable and feel like a failure. But it's not really about being a programmer. It's that I don't know who I am.
  - Oh, this might be because I'm not sure what to say when people ask "what do you do". The only thing I have is programmer. And maybe that by dropping that I don't know what to say. Ah, and I think that links back to the thing about being rich. How do you answer that when all you do is hobbies?
  - You know I could just say I'm retired lol. It's a good start.
  - Actually fuck it. That's what I am. I'm retired. It's the perfect answer for what I am. My job is just an avocation, like working as a walmart greeter.
  - My job situation is pretty funny actually come to think of it. It's all people playing little games. Why get so worked up about it?
  - Like my interest in model trains? Totally something a retired guy does. Look at all of the greybeards in the model railroading forums.
- That framing is actually really helpful. It feels really freeing. I do whatever I want because I'm retired. Being retired doesn't mean laying around doing nothing. It means doing what you think is fun.
- I do still want to program, I've definitely found it fun in the past. I just need to seek out the fun again.
- It's not that I resent being a programmer. It's that I resent needing to have a job lol.
- I can just give up control of my time. Why try and control it. Things come up. You can also do things whenever you want. Doesn't need to be "in the afternoon" or "can't do this because it's before bed". Those are stupid restrictions. Why do you have them? They're just routines you've inherited. But you're retired. What routine do you really need? Think of all the free time you have! There are very few obligations.
- Ah Geoff just reached out to let me know that the speakers came in. He's in until 5:30, so I think I'll build this couch then head over.

* October 26th, 2023
- Hard drives are out for delivery, everything else seems to be coming next week-ish. RAM finally has a delivery date of Nov 1st.
- Wonder if I should just put the 16TB drive into the NAS. Well, move everything from it TO the NAS first, then drop it in. The rest of the drives are 18TB, but eh.
- "If you think something's supposed to hurt, you're less likely to notice if you're doing it wrong. That about sums up my experience of graduate school."
- I think today is "make it POST" day. Hard drives have arrived!
  - Maybe try mounting the power bar to the desk again...
- Trains and Such have responded. They can't order the Hogwarts coaches and they have no idea when they'd be available, so might need to order through the Lionel Store directly. But they can order the universal remote. So may as well do that, also maybe two Wye switches.
  - I feel like I'm gonna want to buy another Ready to Play set at some point. Should probably wait a month. One of the non-themed ones, like a Union Pacific one or something like that.
- I find I have to wipe this display A LOT MORE than I did in Kitchener and I'm not sure why.
- Otherwise I want to try two/three power connections on the train today. Someone online said it shouldn't be an issue, even without isolation (but you can do that of course).
- I still have no idea if or when I'll get the chair mat from Staples...
- It's a good thing Trains and Such had so many runs of 30" track, I'll definitely buy more of that. Good deal.
- Oh interesting, there's a model train layout program specifically for the Mac that's apparently really good: RailModeller Pro ($60). Might pick that up. Oh damn, actively maintained too. They had a video just last month about designing a layout with Fastrack.
- Oh, something else I saw at Trains and Such yesterday was a set of trestle bridges for Fastrack but by MTH trains. Cheaper and seemed to look nicer than the Lionel ones too.
- Apparently the BEST switches for O gauge are from Ross Custom Switches. Atlas has decent track, but apparently their switches are the worst.
- Huh, this thread someone mentions having a problem with the Polar Express on switches: 
  - https://www.modeltrainforum.com/threads/atlas-track-vs-fastrack.97418/page-2#nested_reply_top_post
  - Something about the rollers not being long enough so it loses power, and that sound right. He wired the tender directly to the locomotive and that helps it apparently.
- So to deal with the front pilot wheels being too loose, the way they're cast, you can't really take the spring out. So people recommend adding some weight. I wasn't sure what to use, but then I remembered I have those little weights from the logitech mouse! Mmm, they're a bit too big. Ah, got it. I used some gorilla glue and mounted it at the front of the pilot wheels where it should have more than enough clearance as well as putting more weight at the front. 3.6 grams, we'll see if that helps.
  - If that doesn't work I think I have an idea of what else it could be. Compared to the trailing wheels, the pilot wheels move around a lot laterally within the pilot truck. Like they'll move side to side a lot. I could probably add some glue or something to the axles to keep them more centered and that might help since I think the wheels moving freely could definitely be at issue. Yea that axle is really loosey-goosey.
  - Hmm, the gauge seems correct, it just seems to move a lot within the bearings. Not sure why. There's a little clip on the other side, so I might be able to pop them out and see.
- Oh, my active straps for the Pro controllers are in Calgary as of early this morning. Still says tomorrow for delivery though.
- Should do some Beat Saber. And done.
- Okie dokie, what do for rest of the day??? Main thing would be putting together this NAS.
- God dammit. Mark wants to talk, and I said any time this afternoon, and now I have no idea when he'll actually call...
- I feel like I'm just waiting for this fucking phone call because I know it'll go for like 30 minutes...
- Hmm, tripods for the phonee are pretty cheap actually. About $30. Thing is I kind of want one that will point down so I can have my hands free. Alright bought one, it can point 180deg down, but we'll see how well that works. Only $30, and it doubles as a selfie-stick. Well, if that's coming tomorrow, may as well do the stuff with the NAS then. I kind of want to film this, if only to show Daniel. So what do I do with the rest of my day? I think I can do a bit of programming, I've pulled the book out. And actually, I could go through the Exercises for Programmers on O'Reilly. Should also update that ticket with the suneditor bugs.
- List of stuff Daniel/Chris gave me about SD/LLMs:
  - https://github.com/mudler/LocalAI
  - https://github.com/vladmandic/automatic
  - https://github.com/AbdBarho/stable-diffusion-webui-docker
  - https://forums.unraid.net/topic/98978-plugin-nvidia-driver/ (Docker GPU passthrough for unraid)
- Omg, Suneditor is a fucking piece of crap holy shit. You can't change the loaded plugins or anything since the setOptions function fucks up the state.
  - Hell is other people's Javascript.
- It's probably not a coincidence that I've been doing less programming as I've spent more time on stupid programming tasks at PS. Means something like 90% of my time is diagnosing stupid code that barely works and shoveling crap on top of crap. So my experience with code is mostly negative. Same probably goes for Guix and emacs but in a different direction (not necessarily bad, but under-documented).
  - And maybe it's a matter of me having done this so often that I'm just over it. I don't feel any sense of satisfaction in solving issues with other people's code. Like, I was fixing issues with the train set yesterday, and that was rather satisfying, because it's new. But once you've seen one stupid bug, you've kind of seen them all.
  - Like there's something to be said about becoming competent with a specific technology, but I have no interest in developing a competency with the stuff at PS. And with emacs, it's not that bad, but it's still a bit frustrating in that it feels like I'm fighting shit the entire way up the stack. And by then what have I accomplished?
  - Like it feels like I'd have more fun just writing things from scratch because at least then I can say I did it. It's not that interesting to say you configured some software to work the way you like.
- Perhaps I hate fixing bugs because it feels like it's a statement about my ability and not about the software itself. Like I get to the end of it all, and it just feels like a waste of time and I wish it could have been fixed faster. And each time I fix something like that, I don't feel like I'm growing or learning. I don't feel like I ever get better at fixing those things. It all just seems to take the same amount of time.
- Oh I think the pro controller straps are here.
- Computers seem to bring me more frustration than joy lately, and I'm not sure what to do about it.
- Ah this actually might be why I've been avoiding programming on my own. I'm afraid of running into a situation that turns me off of projects I want to undertake.
- I seem to go through phases with weight lifting where I'll be really into it for a bit, then tune it down.
- Looks like the case comes tomorrow.

* October 25th, 2023
- Stupid standup, stupid retro, stupid company.
- I bought lots of trains lol. I spent $1700. I've spent too much money this month.
  - Unfortunately, could only buy 1 switch, a left hand one.
  - Okay, so Trains and Such has switches on their site. $70 each, so two is $140, and the Outer Pass loop has two of those, and 5 10" and 2 O36 (which I have a ton of now).
  - 5 10" costs 38.75, so should just get the switches themselves. No real point in buying the packs now. I do need another 90deg crossing.
  - Oh, a nice thing I didn't realize was that the bumper packs were sets of two. So I have four bumper sections!
  - I can't seem to get the uncoupling track to work, but I wonder if it was shorting on the carpet...
  - I bought a bunch of 30" sections too. They're essentially 3 10" sections fused together, makes sense.
  - It's the switches that I really need. Really limited by them at the moment. They had some remote ones there too, but they weren't O36 (or at least not in both directions).
- Not expecting any other deliveries today. I think I get some more stuff tomorrow though.
  - Case says Friday.
  - RAM is... who knows.
  - Case rails have now shipped. Says 27th to 1st.
  - Hard drives are tomorrow. Gotcha.
  - HBA still estimates the 8th.
- Prices through Trains and Such are pretty good actually. MSRP for a switch is US$55, that'd be C$75, but they're C$70 at Trains and Such.
  - Oh yea, really good conversion on remote switches. 154 vs something like 170-180.
  - So maybe I order two remote switches, and two manual ones?
  - I should create some labels for the parts and put them on the backs, especially for special pieces. Also the switches have parts that stick out that could break easily. Should put those in a different box.
  - I have so much curved parts though lol. I must have like 24 just from the ready to run sets, then another 4 from the Figure 8.
  - Man these layouts really like going ham with the 1 3/4" pieces. But the 1 3/8" ones are apparently more versatile, since you can use them as essentially blocking tracks since they're wired underneath.
    - Eh, you can buy 14 of them for like $90, that's less than a switch.
  - Looks like all of the Wye switches are O72. Oh interesting, those come with three 1 3/8" sections.
  - I wonder if they can order the Hogwarts coaches?
- Also, still no idea what's up with Staples...
- I should try getting the new NAS mobo/cpu to post today. The fan isn't so large that it'll obscure a bunch of screws I don't think.
- I guess I should put together a list of stuff to order from Trains and Such. Also, I need to put together a list of things I want to watch on the home theatre.
- Stupid dog is barking. Maybe should take her for a walk and then essentially have the afternoon to myself.
- Just noticed that the freight polar express locomotive has a front coupling, unlike the other two, so you could run it as part of a double header.
- I should book a haircut, but I figure I'll do next week or something, that way I have my hair cut just before Lisa and Aquarius are here.
  - And booked!
- I was thinking on the walk with bubs that I can view everything I do as a hobby. I'm a wealthy man who can just do whatever he pleases. I don't even have to be good at anything, I'm just a hobbyist/amateur. I was talking a bit about this with Dan yesterday. I think I've had this idea that I need to do something productive in the sense of making some big impact on the world or building a business, but that's a lot of pressure. And the Feynman story makes sense, like, why am I being so hard on myself, I just need to relax and have fun with things.
- Side note, the past few days I've been feeling... I don't know, hungry? Like my stomach feels empty even just after eating. Not sure what that's about.
- I'm feeling a bit unsure of what to do right now. Think it's time to meditate.
  - I think I'm torn between working on site, vs working on computer, vs working on trains.
  - Too many things I'm interested in!
  - And I also feel like I should do SOME work for PS, since they asked about the ticket this morning. Though don't know where we ended up with that.
  - I'm also a bit torn by the NAS because I think I should record it. Though that's really new to me. I need like a little tripod or something for my phone.
    - Like essentially doing a bunch of unboxing videos.
  - Well an intermediate way to sharing things is to just take pictures! Or little shorts. Yea, pictures are also good because I can put those on my site.
    - I don't have to go all out on sharing with super high production quality. I just need to start sharing anything!
- I think I'm so used to people not being into the stuff that I'm into that I don't think to seek out people who do. It's like they don't exist!
- What am I afraid of?
  - Social rejection mostly I think. That what I do won't be accepted by anyone, or ridiculed.
  - But that's kind of stupid dude. Like, you thought Chalk was shit but people fucking loved it. You're too hard on yourself.
  - I'm also afraid of being "used". And I'm not sure why. Or taken advantage of.
  - I think it comes down to people being really scary to me.
  - Next time I go to the train store I should ask about meetups and if there's anything I can do to help out.
- Lol, why do I feel obligated to work on this website. It's just a fun project. You don't need to work on it right now.
  - Also, you don't need to wait until the "end of the day" to play with your trains. You're trying to fit it into a work schedule. That's wrong.
- Maybe I should try an anti-schedule. Like what's the least work thing I can do right now. Go into the hot tub. Really nice time for it actually.
- Another thing worth exploring is what it means to be a collector. I have this social programming that minimalism is good, and consumerism is bad, but I really like collecting objects that I like for one reason or another.
- I also probably internalized that I wasn't allowed to program at work, or that I wasn't suited for it.
- There must be Calgary vintage computer groups.
- Maybe I'm inflicting emotional torment on myself because I feel like if other people are suffering, I have to suffer with them. So if my mom is working a shitty job, I can't be having a great time telling people about all of the fun I'm having. So I have to feel bad about it.
  - But life is suffering. There's always someone suffering more, and you're just looking at the people in your view selectively.
  - Oh, and I think part of it comes down to feeling bad if Sarah's working down the hall if I appear to be slacking off. Probably why I close the door.
- If Rod is in the store earlier in the day, I should go in first thing. (Or there abouts, mid day is better for traffic anyways).
- I'm feeling a bit hampered by having only a single switch. I think they had some of the other directions, but only as remote controlled, and also not O36 I don't think.
- I wonder if the book store had magazines. I don't remember. I'd like some model train magazines.
- Also didn't look at the Atlas track, not sure if they had any there.
- At some point it'd be cool to get into HO again. But I kind of want to "exhaust" O gauge as much as I can.
- I think I probably stopped fucking around with Guix because I forgot all of the keyboard shortcuts I set up lmao.
- Alright! Went to the train store lmao. Ended up buying a few more of the smaller pieces, a 90deg crossing (so I can actually do the layout I wanted to try yesterday), and then I bought 4 remote switches. Two O60 and two O72, both in a left and right hand variant. From what I saw online, people are like "I've never seen someone regret buying one of the larger ones". The difference between the O60 and O72 isn't actually in the angle of the turnout, it's in the length of the piece.
  - Still need to put in an order for the universal remote, and maybe some Wye switches. Though I can probably wait for those.
  - Oh yea, and I bought some train books at the used book store. I find it's hard to learn about trains online, wikipedia isn't really all that great for pictures.
- Just realized I could reframe work as work (fun stuff I like) and chores (unfun stuff I don't like). That way I can separate working on my own things from working on things like PS which are more chores.
- Alright, I want to clear off the desk a bit so that I can try out the uncoupling track, which means clearing off the new computer stuff. But if I'm doing that, may as well hit the GPUs with some compressed air.
- I'm thinking I'll hit up the hot tub BEFORE dinner, while it's still light out to enjoy the scenery a bit.
- 3090 was in pretty good condition, just dusty. The 3090ti on the other hand has seen better days. Nothing broken from the looks of it, but the heatsink for the AIO had some bent ends, and the finish on the GPU body itself was scuffed up. It was also dustier (makes sense, the owner had dogs), and it smelled sweet, making me think that he must vape (he looks like the type). Hopefully all good though.
  - Compressed air isn't all that great at getting rid of caked on dust. Had to go over them with a que tip to loosen shit up. And the compressed air turns fucking cold real fucking fast.
- Reached out to Trains and Such about the remote and the Harry Potter house coaches.
- Okay, got the uncoupler working! I think the switch came loose the first time and I plugged it in the wrong way.
  - Thing is, when you activate it, it essentially removes all power from the track for a brief second. Which means it'll probably turn off the locomotives. That's why people seem to suggest using the transformer and wiring with aux power instead.

* October 24th, 2023
- So weekly meeting with Daniel and Will cancelled, and 1-1 with Danel cancelled again. Guess Daniel is busy fighting a fire at PS!
- So just the 1-1 with Jonathan, and my appointment this afternoon. Will probably want to leave earlier than usual given the weather today.
- I guess I should clear our driveway too. Yayyyyy.
- Gonna play some VR. Going to take the Quest 3 down and do a direct comparison of the Plus and Pro controllers.
- Oh nice, gonna get the UGREEN charger today.
  - Newegg order is still at the sort facility in Calgary. Kinda odd.
  - Drives are expected Thursday.
  - Case on Friday.
  - No idea for RAM, I think it might be untracked?
  - HBA says November 8th. At least I can run all of my drives from the mobo. I wonder if I'll be able to at least try swapping the drives around. Well, I can try with my current extra drive.
  - Keyboards are November 1st.
  - Rack rails are Oct 27-Nov 1.
- At least I'll be able to test the mobo/CPU/GPUs, nice to have 64GB of RAM just lying around lmao.
  - Still really curious to see if the 4x48GB kit works at XMP, it's weird how it's the only one listed as 4 socket support. I wonder if that's a typo. Either way, 3600 isn't awful.
  - Oh interesting, there are some 4x16GB kits listed as 4 socket supported.
- So I tried the Pro controllers with the Quest 3. Once again it was really annoying to pair them, I don't know what they're doing. I'm not sure if it's because the Quest 3 goes to sleep and then they can't find them or what. Anyways, once I got it working, it was noticeable that they are heavier than the Pluses. And I didn't do as well in Beat Saber with them! Part of that could be from my arms/shoulders being tired (from doing upper body yesterday). My best guess though is that it's actually due to the active straps on the Plus making the controllers drift in my hands a lot less. So it'll be interesting to see once I have the active straps for the Pros. I find the Pros really move around in my palms so I'm constantly readjusting them and I think I miss notes because of them slowly moving. And the controllers being heavier means the move more I think. Otherwise, the primary difference is that the Pros have a nicer haptic feedback, it's more intense. And the weight is definitely nice for working out. Otherwise, not too different. It's nice to have the Pros for the Quest 2 though, huge upgrade on that front.
- Also occurred to me on the way up that I might not like doing things when I have something coming up due to when I was showing dad the OpenGL stuff just before we left. So now I have a negative emotion attached to working on things with a looming thing to do.
- I wonder if I should set up a second Github account just for SirFrancisTowne. Might not be a bad idea. Can also use the new domain.
  - Should also set that domain up with the Instawiki Google Account.
- So I have O'Reilly access through PS. Now looking at the programming languages ones. There's a book I have downloaded called "Exercises for Programmers", it would count for 2h, which would be a good start. Might be helpful to read through.
- Hopefully the active straps for the Pro Controllers arrive tomorrow. Just checked and they cleared customs in Vancouver this morning.
- Cancelled the meeting with Jonathan. So nothing until 1:15ish when I need to leave to see Dan.
- Before I go to the train store, I should figure out how much track I'll have between two sets, and the expansion sets (I hope they have them).
  - Hogwarts: 8 O36, 2 10", 1 Terminal, 1 Plug-Expand-Play (both 10").
  - Polar Express: 8 O36, 2 10", 1 Terminal, 1 Plug-Expand-Play (both 10").
  - Ok, this is very confusing. I don't know if the switches are the same for O31 and O36, I think it depends on how long the extra part is...
  - Outer Passing Loop: 2 O36, 5 10", 1 LH and 1 RH Manual Switches, 2 Quarter Curves
  - Inner Passing Loop: 2 O36, 1 LH and 1 RH Manual Switches, 2 Quarter Curves (okay, so the inner one is stupid, better to buy two outers if they have them).
  - Figure 8: 4 O36 Curves, 4 5", 1 90 crossover
  - Siding Track: 3 10", 1 LH Manual Switch, 1 Quarter Curve, 1 Uncoupling Track, 1 Earthen Bumper
- So that's all of them. So if I get the Polar Express, outer, figure 8, and siding track:
  - 22 O36, 12 10" (or rather 16 with the terminals), 4 5", 3 Quarter Curves, 2 LH, 1 RH, 1 Crossover, 1 Uncoupling, 1 Earthen Bumper. Lotta loops.
  - If we add another Kit that's another 8 O36, 4 10", if we add another passing loop, that's another 2 O36, 5 10", 2 Quarter Curves, and two switches.
- Now let's look at the builds to find out what other parts we need to try them all.
  - Hmm, so essentially none of these layouts lmao. A lot of them need like 4 1/2" track, and 1 3/4" track, and O36 half curve. But I also want to get some really long runs. And some O72 Wye Switches. Oh damn, like some 30" tracks. And 1 3/8". I should put these all into Apple Notes so that I have them, and a rough idea of how many I'll need. At least I'm good for O36 and Straight pieces for the most part lmao.
- Oh one of them calls for a blocking section. I was like what's that? It's for connecting different runs of track to different power blocks from the looks of it.
  - Oh wait, I think it's for the crossing grades. The layout has them on either side of the crossing so I'm guessing it allows the crossing to detect that something's coming.
  - Ah, but yea, it's for separating blocks of track, which is more important for traditional layouts I guess where the trains aren't remote controlled.
- Okay, so the 1 3/8" are really rare, looks like you only need like 1 of them. Same with the half curves, only need like 2.
  - The holiday ones have a 45, and O48 curve and half curve. Ah one of them needs two 1 3/8". Oh and another uses 4 O36 half curves. And another uses 6 O48 curves.
  - Damn, sorta hard to buy enough shit for everything. At least the track is pretty cheap I think.
  - You know, at least the Polar Express freight set uses a different engine than the passenger. So you could get both.
- Ooo, Newegg came. Good shit. Everything available to test pretty much.
  - Reminds me, I should get a can of compressed air from MemoryExpress if they have them.
- Eh, traffic says 30min to get to the appointment. So 1:15pm should be lots of time. But I should go check the mail and shovel the drive before I go. UGREEN was listed as delivered.
- Hmm, got a customs bill from Fedex for something shipped here back in September... don't know what it was.
- Nice, Ugreen charger set up and plugged in with the mac, the oculus, and the steam deck. It has three USB-C ports labelled as "laptop", with one being "phone" and then two more USB-As that are "phone". I'd use those for the sex toys I guess. It's a chonky boy, pretty small actually, but hefty.
- Okay, yea, MemoryExpress has compressed air in stock. Different sizes too.

* October 23rd, 2023
- Got my Tims, now on the stupid meeting, then chatting with Daniel.
- Need to send Aleem money for his camera.
- Gotta change the cat crapper too.
- Looks like a big chunk of the Newegg order will be here today. It's in Calgary as of early this morning. The PSU, the cooler, the CPU, and the SSDs.
  - Hard drives on Wednesday. The rest? Who knows?
  - Huh, the HBA is out for delivery... to the shipping hub??? How weird.
- Daniel has rescheduled.
- I think today I should do some reading on Unraid. Get prepped ya know.
- Also, still no idea when my new chair mat is coming...
- I want to go to the train store again. Too bad they close at 5pm, means I need to go during the day.
  - I want to see if they have the Fastrack expansion sets, and then pick up the Polar Express one (or maybe both???).
  - I was thinking it'd be SO cool to have a bunch of track going down the hallway. I wonder how much you can power?
  - I guess the transformers themselves should carry more than enough power, the primary thing is getting it there. From the looks of it, you need to just wire up the track better because the connections between the tracks aren't always the greatest. And Fastrack is designed to allow every track length to become a terminal.
  - Fuck, I think model trains might mean I need to learn to solder... I mean, that's a good skill for computers AND trains.
  - They use 16Gauge speaker wire...
  - There are prepared terminal sections you can buy. I guess I'd just need a better transformer like the CW80.
  - You can buy a railer accessory (you put it on the track, then roll the locomotive or car over it and it lines it up on the track).
  - Ooo, it'd be cool to get a little train semi-permanently going around my office that I can connect out to the hallway.
- Oh damn just got the motherboard. That was way faster than expected. Well, that was Purolator, and the delivery from Newegg is with them and it's not listed as Out for Delivery, so must be coming tomorrow instead.
- Oh you know what, I need to buy rack slides...
  - Ok, ordered an iStarUSA one recommended by someone no Reddit since the Rosewill ones are total shit apparently.
  - That server is going to be HEAVY.
  - Remember that they go BETWEEN Us since they sit sort of in the middle.
- Man I keep needing to use the washroom today. Woke up with the shits this morning.
  - Gonna do that again, then play some VR.
- Keerthi sending me more bugs, but they're all Suneditor bugs smh.
- I've decided I'll do the train store tomorrow after my therapist appointment. Perfect time to go!
- I'm thinking I should do more work on my site today. I think what I'm stuck on is how to assign paths for the musings so that they have a stable identity.
  - I now understand why blogs have titles, it's one way of handling this.
  - I could go by timestamp, but it'd probably be the timestamp of when I first create it.
  - I could also design like an emacs UI for creating them and saving them.
- Otherwise, I think I should start playing around with PAIP again. Maybe I should do it on Nebula.
  - Was going to search "Nebula" and then remembered that I should switch the find function in this emacs config.
- Reading through the Unraid docs and it explains how parity works, which was sort of mysterious to me, but it's actually simple math. The parity drive must be the same size as the largest drive in the cluster. Then it's just a matter of XORing all of the drives together, and the result is the parity bit. Then, if one of the drives dies, you can figure out what its value was by solving for its bits as a variable. XOR only gives you one failure though. To allow for two failures, you need to drives, and then XORing doesn't cut it. Unraid adds a second bit using Reed-Solomon coding.
- Woah, there are specific passenger cars for each Hogwarts house... gonna have to buy them all lmao.
- Reading some of Introspect again. 3.1 is about "investigating your boredom". It recounts how Richard Feynman became disgusted by physics once he felt obliged to advance the future of science. That he was supposed to be doing "important" work. He only broke out of the malaise when he decided to give up entirely on "doing important work", and just fool around for the sake of it. What's crazy is that it was him fooling around with wobbly plates that led to the equations that he won the Nobel prize for.
  - And I was just thinking that "oh, it's not my boredom that's the issue, there's A LOT that I find interesting". What I find holds me back is this feeling that I need to be doing something important and productive, and as soon as I think that I just don't do it.
  - It's also interesting that I feel that way in part because it feels like I need to be doing something for work, and that the stuff I like fooling around with isn't valuable. And so I have this mental block that says "you can't make a career out of playing with model trains", and you know what? First of all, who cares you're rich. And second of all, people doooo!!!! You just need to share it with the world.
  - I've also been thinking about sharing wrong I think. I think my want to share things has been predicated on doing it with the intention of maybe monetizing it at some point. That is, I'm making it a job from the get go.
  - But what I should be doing is sharing for the sake of MEETING NEW FRIENDS.
  - Like, it's kind of funny. I posted the photo of the ultrasound this weekend, which got a lot of likes. But I also posted a picture of me getting a trainset, and THAT GOT MORE LIKES THAN ANY TWEET I'VE EVER MADE (that wasn't a reply to a huge thread).
  - And I might feel like I need to work with WIll and Daniel because I don't want to lose them as friends.
  - It mentions that some people need to hear the suggestion to "satisfice". Like, you don't need to be perfect in everything you do. And I think that feeling of needing to be perfect goes WAY BACK. It comes from school in that I mostly got praise for being good at school.
    - OH. And that's probably why it hurt so much when dad didn't look at the thing I was doing with OpenGL. It felt like my personal interests weren't respectable.
- At first I was a bit demotivated with the trains because I felt like I didn't have any space for them in the house. That is, I needed to have a place with scenery, that was permanent. But then I realized, why? I can just run them on the floor! And every time I put them together, I can try a new layout. And I can keep all of that nice and tidy in boxes (especially long track, it stacks and packs easily).
- Oh you know what, I think what I should do with Nebula first to get back into the swing with it is to pull this emacs config, since it's largely similar.
- Bro, who cares if your site has stable links right now. No one even knows about it, and if they really need to find it they can use web.archive.org.
  - It probably doesn't even matter at the moment since you'll want to change it a lot anyways.
- There are no rules dude. You've already won the game from a financial point of view. Everything you do now is for fun. What would you have done with dad? What will you want to do with your kids?
- Celebration, that is processing your positive emotions, is just as important as processing your negative ones (grief).
- Visa mentions that he does box breathing in the morning when he wakes up. 4 seconds in, 4 seconds hold, 4 seconds out, 4 seconds hold, repeat. Essentially what I've been doing with the alternate nose breathing. But I should maybe focus more on holding.
- He also talks about taking 100 selfies, because men often report feeling more confident and sexy after doing it. It's a way to make your self-image a dynamic rather than static thing.
  - Same could be said about "take 100 nudes".
- Okay, I think I wanted to pull down the emacs config to Nebula. Though that might be a big task. I kind of want to figure out my site.
- Ahhhh, I'm feeling a bit overwhelmed all of a sudden. I think it's because I have too many things I want to do. That's actually almost certainly the issue with Cyfer, it feels like TOO MUCH. Meanwhile, the trains I have a clear next step for (buy the other sets).
- Just ordered the Famicom and NES versions of the 8Bitdo keyboard. They've been sitting as a tab for awhile now, and I do need a spare keyboard for the basement when I'm building the new machine. I also think they're super cute.
- Okay, so what's the simplest way to get started building this site?
  - Well, could start with a bare HTML index page, at least then I can figure out what I want in terms of layout.
- Got a decent little layout working. Has the SirFrancisTowne painting as the hero image, then a nice section for content. Will eventually want to make a mobile layout, but eh. Good enough.
  - Something that's becoming clear already is that I think I want a web server...
  - If I just used a web server, with something like Guile, then I could mix all of my content and code in a single repo, and I'd just need to push up the repo and boom, it'd have the latest.
  - Kind of goes to show that it'd be nice to have the server essentially as a service that just sits and then waits for updates to a repository, i.e. it incrementally fetches and sees if there's an update, and if there is, loads it.
  - That way, I could design something where I just essentially need to sign my messages, and the system views that as a new thing to show. The webserver itself is essentially following a CRDT.
  - That'd also be a cool project in that I could just run it on my own personal server at home and have it available via tailscale. Most of the time it'd just be cached anyways.
  - Like, all of my content should exist as a giant tree datastructure, and the webserver is just a projection of that content.
  - Then you just need a resolution mechanism to find out what the root of the structure should be.
  - Also, no content is ever deleted. It'd just be replaced with a tombstone that points to another structure, or one saying that it's been removed.
  - Kind of interesting idea actually. Treating my site as a projection of a database. If I do that actually, then it's as simple as keeping everything in plain S-Expressions for the time being. Yea, kind of a good excuse to implement essentially my own little git.
  - OOooo, that would be cool. Essentially make my own site the very first Cyfer space. I imagine a little banner at the top a la stumble-upon that can take you to other cyfer spaces.
  - It's like rebuilding the web, using the browser like a skinsuit.
  - Your @ handle is a Cyfer space address.
  - Then yada yada yada, eventually you can code from within it. I mean I'll want code snippets in the content anyways.
- Huh, took the dog for a walk, came back and checked the mail and got my CAA membership card. Except... it's the one for my old account.
- Yea, I think I should be looking to run this as a server essentially. That sounds kind of fun. But will need some research.
- I'm really confused about codecrafters. Do you need a subscription or not? Also, can't use Common Lisp, but I could use Ruby and that'd give me a chance to tune a Ruby installation for emacs. And I need to configure emacs for JSON and HTML anyways.
  - Well, did a bit of tweaking and have JSON at least rendering a bit nice.
  - Now did some fucking around with hooks. I can probably remove a bunch of the stuff from prelude. It's set up rather weird.
- Think I should work out now, or rather soon. We'll be going grocery shopping after work. Need snacks and lunches and shit.
- I think I got a bit discouraged from fucking around with emacs... doesn't feel like I did anything.
- Yea, should do some gym. Upper body today.
- I think I'm also a bit unsure where to go from here with the site. Like, I like how this looks, but now essentially I need content. And I don't know where to put that. I think I need to do a bit of random Lisp programming to get inspired. I keep thinking about ANSI Common Lisp and how PG essentially builds a static site generator.
  - I'm still also unsure how to create new entries.
  - Could be as simple as: keep it in a repo, have a github action that runs a build and pushes to Firebase. Also need to figure out how Firebase handles single-page app style links.
  - Hmmm, if I want non .html style routes, going to need a web server I think. Then I have to worry about running it... so much work.
- Honestly, probably not a bad exercise anyways. Make server, respond with content.
  - Server can also ingest data for pages and generate HTML for them without needing dynamism.
  - Also, gives me a reason to get familiar with HTTP on CL, which we'll likely want for Rembrandt anyways.
  - I think I just don't want to use Spinneret, and so that means writing my own such system.
- Hmmmm. I'm sitting at the computer, thinking I'd like to work on something. But not sure what.
  - Ah, you know it's probably because I'm expecting a text from Will/Liza about hot tubbing, so I don't want to get really into something.
- Was playing with the train. So ready for more track.
- Ah, when the server first starts, just have it load everything from files. We could also have a refresh option, and it'd just reload them anyways.
  - And then I can put those in a content-addressable store later.
- What do I need to do next? Let's think about it some more.
  - Need a little web server.
    - Also need to think about how that works behind a reverse proxy like nginx. Don't want to expose a random Lisp instance to the web. Also might want to put it on another VLAN.
  - Then need to come up with a little file hierarchy for rendering things out.
    - Oh, I could make them scripts essentially. Like, have the server emulate the directory, just dropping the extension.
    - Like have a directory called sitemap. Within it is a bunch of .lisp files representing the pages with the given name. That's perfect for right now.
    - It just loads the file, which will be data, and then applies a transformation over the data to turn it into HTML.
    - Then, I can just apply changes to that directory, and boom, update.
    - Actually I don't even need a web server to begin with. I can do a direct mapping to HTML.
    - Only thing then is how do I deal with stuff like "chrome", like the nav around everything.
    - I mean sure, may as well build a static site generator why not. Only really need a server if I want to drop the .html. Good way to get started.
    - Oh, I suppose they might be route specific. I could also just add instructions within the data itself. Like, here's the preamble, here's what it's called. Here are the tags. Blah, blah, blah.
    - In which case, yea, gonna just follow ANSI Common Lisp for inspiration. Maybe go through it to get a feel, and then try to build something myself.
    - One thing I think it'd be cool to do is have symbols represent links, since that's more or less what they are.
    - Ah, see interesting thing about CL, @ is just any other character. Doesn't have a special meaning unlike Clojure. Wait no it does in unquote splicing... I do like that ~ is for unquote in Clojure rather than ,. I'd rather not use @ for splicing though, since I'd prefer it be available for identifiers. Really, ... is better for splicing. Hell, that even exists in Scheme with a lot of macro systems.
    - Once I have my site as data, then I can think about making a nicer interface for writing them. Helllooo emacs.
    - Another thing I could do is have the data loaded into essentially a closure. Or actually. We just write everything as a lambda that receives a request object or something.
      - Or no, that's probably overthinking things at the moment. I think what we mostly want to do is have our own parser for our own reader, so that all of my posts are defacto Cyfer Expressions.
    - I can call them all Lisp, or Scheme. Or I could just bite the bullet and make my own Cyfer mode... Eh, just keep it as Lisp for now. Or rather, we can create them all as a custom shortcut, and then just set up an association in Emacs for basic Lisp editing, which could then be switched out for our own major mode later.
    - I think one thing I want to do with Cyfer is to use CamelCase for struct/class constructors, that way it's relatively straightforward to create trees of data structures. All of those being list like objects, sequences I guess. Then you need some way to assign arbitrary properties though. Could do it with keywords, but that seems odd. That distinction between CamelCase for constructors and kebab-case for functions means it's easier to see when something is allocating something vs not.
    - I wonder if you could use & for splicing. It's only used for &rest and &keywords in lambda lists, and the only time its meaning would change is immediately after a ~. And by convention, nothing should be assigned to &rest and &keywords. They're sort of reserved and it'd be bad form to use them otherwise.
      - So that just means that the parser needs to check for ~&. That is a slight complication, but whatever.
      - Alternatively, it just means splat all the time. That'd be good as a way to essentially replace apply. (+ 1 2 3 &rest)
        - What would that look like internally?
        - Wait, is that just the . then? I suppose it is. I just don't like having the dot for tuples. It would essentially parse to (+ 1 2 3 & rest)
        - Could you have mutiple ones in a row though?
        - Apply is probably better. Using syntax for that always felt... kinda gross to me. Variadic functions kinda need to look different. But we can probably still use it for backquote (among other things for destructuring as well). That's kind of how Clojure uses it I think. & means etc. and then you can destructure whatever comes after it. Although ... would also be kinda dope.
        - Although we could do the same thing with @, just feels a bit odd since it'd only be used for that.
- Okay, so Liza is done at 8:30, so I expect they'll want to be here around the usual time. Need to change the cat crap. Uhhh, should probably just do that and get it out of the way.
- What would the lambda lists look like?
  - (defn none ())
  - (defn one (first))
  - (defn two (first second))
  - (defn three? (first second (third)))
  - (defn four? (first second & third))
  - Honestly, once again could go the Clojure route. Really functions are either fixed arguments, or they are variadic.
  - If you want to get fancy, you should destructure the arguments yourself.
- I do kind of like the & to represent "more stuff follows". Then you could destructure on it.
  - Optional args are essentially filling in the blanks to a list.
  - Would also let you do stuff like assign &args to mean "the args provided in the nearest enclosing block".
  - Common Lisp just lets you collapse everything a bit by letting you do: (&rest args &optional a b c) so that you can access everything provided, but also name specific ones. Whereas you'd have to break it up otherwise into something like ((& args) (let [a (first args) b (second args) c (third args)])).
  - Really though, I should seek to make something more simple to begin with. You can always add puns later. Since you'd need to implement destructuring anyways at that point. May as well be able to implement the language without those as like a lower layer. Either way. I think it might make sense to reserve & for the system along with #, @, and maybe even $ (as prefixes that is). Comma can then be whitespace a la clojure. And . is just a regular old character, potentially used for namespacing. Oh, and I guess : is reserved as well.
  - But honestly, reserving a few of those characters is still more expressive than most languages. And it's still more expressive than most Lisps since it'll be case sensitive.

* October 22nd, 2023
- Holy fuck, slept in until 11am today. Just hecking *snore*.
- Went in the hot tub, such a fucking good day for it (nice and cool with a slight breeze). Feels like living in a mountain get away.
- Was watching train videos this afternoon, I really want to make a train museum.
- Lol forgot to write yesterday about buying the second 3090. So everything has been purchased for the rig. Just needs to be built.
- Morphsuit sucks. Was too tight, and I think I ripped it, wouldn't even fit in the whole way. Oh well.
- Also, I found the account that had the blog with nudes. It wasn't actually the account I was thinking of. It was Liz Lovelace.

* October 21st, 2023
- I bought a model train set today... I love it so much :))))
  - Fuck, this is the sort of joy I should be looking for in my life.
  - It's like being a kid again.
  - Except now, I have the resources to do whatever I want! I'm no longer limited by my toys.
  - My life should be about playing with and making toys.
  - I should buy some old computers I've always wanted.
  - Record myself being a kid with it essentially.
  - I can enjoy sex and masturbation as much as I want. But there are so many other things that bring me joy too.

* October 20th, 2023
- Taylor Swift was decent, was a little long for me as not a rabid fan.
- Was having lots of interesting thoughts during it though. Like: "to feel different things you need to do different things". That's a tweet I think, but the point stands.
  - I was also thinking that I should de facto quit my job. Tell my boss that Sarah's pregnant and that I honestly don't think I'll be coming back.
  - I don't need money right now. I need free time to myself. So fuck this stupid job.
  - I was also thinking about drawing, and music. Like I think part of the reason I didn't progress more with music is because I was afraid of having an audience.
  - Although if I were to start taking up music again, I'd probably want to focus on vocal training. Which I think would be good for me generally.
  - I don't think I've been GROWING a lot recently.
- Ok so the power line conditioner on the quote from K&W is a bit less sus, it's a rack mounted surge protector essentially. The one I have for my rack is $100+, and it's el cheapo. Once speakers are going, that's a lot of watts actually.
- Today I should sign up for ebay and then order the HBA and the drives from serverpartdeals. Daniel also gave me some reading to do:
  - https://trash-guides.info/
  - https://trash-guides.info/Hardlinks/How-to-setup-for/Unraid/
- Ah the HBA has 2 SFF-8643 connectors, which I guess are mini-SAS, so I need to buy 2 adapters. Looks like StarTech sells them, and can get them on Amazon. https://www.amazon.ca/StarTech-com-SAS43SAT1M-Internal-Cable-SFF-8643-Silver/dp/B01M1D8ICT/ref=sr_1_5?crid=1QDZI4QZZYK6A&keywords=SFF-8643&qid=1697817463&sprefix=sff-8643%2Caps%2C137&sr=8-5&th=1
- Everything has been ordered! Going to be lots of fun putting this all together. :)
- I'll have to do some reading on unraid. I figure it just makes sense to go with that since it's very popular and Daniel also uses it. Plus it can run docker containers, so I can always generate them from Guix anyways.
- It's funny that I think I did more programming sitting on the couch with Oblivion than I did sitting at the computer here. I wonder why. It's probably because I have a habit of consumption at the computer.
- I think the most pressing project I need to work on is my personal blog since it's essentially a showcase for everything else I want to do. Right now, if I write things (be it code or just random thoughts) they don't actually go anywhere. Need to make that shit public yo. The quickest thing is to just set up a project folder with some plain HTML. Everything I want to do is static for the most part anyways. Could probably just do the same thing I did for mom actually, and that would be a good thing since then I can manage hers and mine together.
  - I think part of why I haven't made a blog is that I don't know which PERSONA I want to showcase publicly. Do I really want to go with Ryan McKay-Fleming, or should I lean into the Francis Towne thing. Or maybe, something new???
  - Okay, so SirFrancisTowne.com is available. May as well buy that. Lol, there's a .town tld. Could go for sirfrancis.town.
  - Alright, own the domain. Next thing would just be setting up the same firebase app stuff as mom. Then I can generate my site from emacs into it as an output.
  - Oh interesting, cloudflare has email routing now... ooo, there are email workers too.
  - Hmm, I have mom's stuff on my instawiki.app account. You know, maybe I should switch that to be sirfrancistowne.
- I seem to think Robert Greene talked about personas and pseudonyms and stuff like that before. It may have been in the art of seduction.
  - It's almost like using a mask to unmask. Like being sirfrancistowne means it's me but not me.
  - Also, having a pseudonym is probably good for Cyfer anyways, since its whole thing will be about different personas.
- Alright, setup the repository, the firebase account, and just verifying the domain now which will take a bit. Then will probably want to switch my instawiki over.
  - Ok, well while that's doing its thing may as well go play some beat saber. Now's the usual time for me anyways.
  - Hmm, it's still doing a too many redirects. I found something online that said to set SSL to full instead of flexible, which I did. But firebase is also seeing DNS records that are from namecheap I think.
  - I'll try the Advanced mode now instead.
  - Well, it might take a few hours, but that doesn't stop me from thinking up blog ideas. I wish I could find that person from Twitter that had like NSFW stuff on their site. I wonder if it might have been on Safari? Like on my phone.
  - Man I have no idea. It's really annoying that twitter won't show you more than a few people in the following/followers tabs, so I can't even search through people who I think would have them as mutuals.
- Oh dope, the blog is working!
- I took some CBD:CBN last night and it was really nice for the concert actually.
- Lol, so it was really easy for me to SET UP a website, but now that I'm at the part where I have to decide what to put up... crickets.
- So while I was doing beat saber I was moving my body a lot in a more natural feeling my body way, and I think I stopped doing that because it's the thing I do that feels the weirdest. Like I was thinking last night at the theatre that I couldn't see myself dancing or doing the kind of stuff Taylor Swift does on stage, I'd feel really embarrassed by it. And part of that comes from being teased about how I naturally carried myself in middle school. That pickle in the ass comment by what's his face really stuck with me, and I think I've been essentially watching my movements ever since so as not to seem weird. Or even just Suraj pointing out how bouncy my gait is. Like why do people comment on it so much? It's perhaps the biggest indicator I get from people that I'm weird. But it's also probably made me more stilted generally. AH, because so many people already comment on it, it's probably why I don't want to be seen as gay, because it feels like something else I have to be self-conscious about.
  - The thing is, all of those things MAKE ME FEEL GOOD! I like acting autistic and gay. Why listen to people who are miserable?
  - Also it is funny that I have a bouncy gait. Why would it be BAD that I have a spring in my step? That's literally an expression people use to denote joy!
- I should draw the things I find sexy. Like I was thinking last night about being overwhelmed by like black slime or ooze. I've always been interested in that, but not sure what to call it? It's like venom, being possessed by some entity that takes full control of your body and uses you while you're just there to be used.
- Sarah's ordering McD's. So gonna get that, then should meditate.
  - Ohhhh, I should add creatine to the shake.
- Will's picking me up around 5 for dinner/opera.
- About the only other thing I want to do today is work out before heading off to dinner/opera.
- Maybe I should get a morph suit or something. I like the look of that stuff, but the problem is getting something that feels cool since I'd worry about getting hot.
  - Ordered one lol. Should be interesting, it looks like they're easier to get into than the captain america one since they have two zippers.
- I think on my site I want a musings section, which would be for my writing. Maybe start with just that, then add like code later.
  - I like minimalist, so mostly just text (nice font, centered with a max width, maybe picture on top).
  - I like musings since it implies any random length rather than blog which implies longer form.
  - Don't be too worried about what it looks like, it's a living thing, you can tweak it from now until forever. In fact, you could even have different styles for different posts.
- There must be meditations involving the genitals. I feel like that'd really speak to me.
- Every time I remember I'm wearing the fox ears, I get this intense feeling of joy starting in my stomach. It feels like excitement.
- I can probably reframe a lot of the things I currently see as work in terms of fun things to do. There are just some topics I don't really have too much interest in, that's the hard ones.
- I think I'll use Berkeley Mono for the code snippets. Not sure about the rest of the body text though. Okay, it's covered by the license too. I'll also need a typewriter case font for symbols and things.
- I wonder how I can use sex for reinforcing things I want to do, or for creative inspiration? Like, there was a thread of tweets the other day (since deleted) about using masturbation to condition herself to get off on math.
- Ok, need to meditate, then off to gym! Then shower, and watch VR porn and masturbate. Because I keep thinking about it and don't do it.
- Just finished working out and I was watching Dr. K.'s ADHD modules, and in it he was talking about the hunter/farmer dichotomy, which I knew about, but what's interesting was an example he gave. He talks about how someone he worked with did alright in school and found it tough, but once he got into corporate finance work he was just miserable, and what ended up happening was he found a job in real estate and now he's thriving because real estate is a million different things on the go. And I was like, omg that's what Sarah needs to do. She has often expressed an interest in it, but I think her problem is that she doesn't know where to start. She doesn't have anyone in her family who's had a job like that, so she's used to the college -> desk job pipeline. What she should be doing is talking to Mariangela and seeing how SHE started in real estate and then essentially asking to work for her. And if she needs for instance to get a real estate license, what better time to study for that than on mat leave. Seems like duuhhhh. I think it'd be really good for her, she expressed that her dream life was travelling and what that's really about is that she needs to get out of the house. She's miserable staying in the same place, and I get it. Like, I need to do a bunch of different things, it's why I really liked doing random projects at the office or picking up Ikea furniture. It's the need for variety, and at least I get out and go for walks and shit, she doesn't. This is a job that would get her out of the house.
- So I started watching VR, but I can't shake the feeling that it's scripted and acted. It's really weird. I don't like that in normal porn either, but there's less "home made" stuff in VR. I think it's because I kind of prefer watching rather than being POV.
- Still feeling guilty about masturbating right now, but I think that's also a matter of me feeling shame about being a highly sexual person. What else would I be doing right now? Some other form of entertainment... also bro this is what you wanted to do this afternoon. You've done everything else you planned for and you have a lot going on tonight. Chill the fuck out.
  - Actually, come to think of it, the guilt is that you're not asking Sarah to have sex.

* October 19th, 2023
- Was thinking last night that I should be putting together a list of movies/shows I want to watch on the BIG SCREEN.
  - Because if I don't, I won't use it!
  - If I want to spend more time indulging in things I enjoy, I should list them out.
- Lol, lmao. I won't receive my new controllers today due to a mechanical delay at the sorting facility in Calgary. So it hasn't gone out. Who knows, maybe they'll fix it and it'll end up on a truck.
- Also, I need to build out the NAS component list. Also, need to pick up a second 3090.
- Big mercedes bill. Between service, tire, and there's a bunch of smaller things that are just starting to come due, all like $600 something a pop. Gonna be like $3-4K.
- My point about taking a sabbatical could just as easily be achieved by just spending more time NOT doing work things.
- Controllers arrived! Should test them out with the Quest 2. It'll also be interesting to see how using the Quest 2 is after having been using the Quest 3.
  - Just ordered some active style grips for them.
  - They charge with a little USB-C charging pad, and it makes me realize that I have too many USB-C chargers. I'm thinking of ordering a 200W one from UGreen that has 4 USB-C ports on it (as well as 2 USB-As). Then ordering some cables too. That way I can just have a single one on the workbench for the mac, the steam deck, the Ally, and the Quest 3/Pro. Should mean that I can mount that power bar again since there'll be less weight on it.
    - Ordered.
  - I was also curious so I looked it up and the 3M double sided tape is apparently the best.
- We have the ultrasound today at 2:15ish, and then I have to pick the dog up tonight, and then we're also going to see Taylor Swift in theatre at the VIP this evening. So not a whole lot going on today lmao.
- I think my plan for today should be to figure out the stuff for the NAS, and maybe start ordering it.
  - Especially the stuff on Ebay, since it'll likely take longer to get here.
    - Which means setting up an Ebay account, which might be good for buying old macs later anyways.
  - I've also reached out to two more people on FB about 3090s. One is a Founder's Edition.
  - So I have 1 video card so far, although they aren't exactly pressing.
  - I need the case (Rosewill), the CPU (7950X), an SSD for the boot disk, PSU, RAM.
    - Unknown is the cooler. Not sure what to do about that. Especially since we'll have water cooling on one of the GPUs which takes space.
    - Then, also need to order a bunch of hard drives.
    - I mean that's probably it come to think of it.
    - Maybe do some reading on the Rosewill case dimensions.
    - I don't even really need the HBA yet. I can have 4 drives on the machine just on the mainboard, though probably worth just ordering it and making sure it works.
    - The AIO GPU is gonna be a bit jank I think. I think it has enough clearance? But it'll be tight. Not sure where the fans themselves will be mounted.
    - The radiator is 240mm, so two 120mm fans, I wonder if they'll fit where two of the 120mm fans already are.
    - Noctua probably has some lower profile fans.
    - Ok, good deal on the Mobo right now on Amazon. $464 vs like $600 regular. There's an open box one on Newegg for $391, but may as well go for amazon.
    - Alright, ordered the Mobo.
    - A lot of the rest will be through Newegg I think.
    - Ok, so the Seasonic Prime PX1600 ATX3 PSU has two of the 12VHPWR connectors, which is what the 3090s use. Ohhh, I think it's the 3090tis that use it, looks like the standard 3090s use a 12pin. That's okay, future proof it a bit.
    - Alright, everything is in the cart except the cooler. Let's see what the total is lmao.
      - LOL, $2800. We're looking at nearly $4000 on the base components before GPUs and additional storage.
    - Adding in two 2TB 980Pros that will be set up as Unraid cache disks, then a 970Evo 1TB drive for the boot disk.
    - Although, people are saying that it's better to just use a Thumbdrive for the boot drive, and I suppose that makes sense.
      - And the SSD drives should be mirrored. So 2 2TBs then is good.
    - $3417.92. Plus about $500 for the mobo, so justttt under $4K total. Then all storage is extra.
    - And ordered! I'll look at HDD and HBAs later.
- Otherwise, I should also start putting together a list of things I want to watch.
- Oh shit, Threadripper's announced today.
- So tried out the new controllers with the Quest 2. They're a lot more like the Touch Plus controllers. They felt a bit heavier, but I wonder how much of that is due to me doing upper body yesterday. Anyways, if they are a bit heavier, means they're better for working out. It took awhile to pair them, and I was confused why the right one wasn't pairing. And it turns out it was updating firmware... of course. Anyways, they are definitely better than the Quest 2's base controllers, and they make the experience a lot better overall. What's surprising is that I didn't feel like the Quest 2 was a huge downgrade over the 3. At least for beat sabre. Like the 3 is obviously clearer and brighter too I think, but the Quest 2 is perfectly reasonable, especially with new controllers.
- The ultrasound is at 2:45, and it's 30min away. On top of that I expect I'll hear from Mercedes to pick the car up. And Sarah wants to get groceries, so now I'm wondering if it just makes sense to pick the dog up on the way back from the ultra sound. Like I don't want to just be driving from place to home to place to home to place. I'll spend the whole fucking day driving.
- Why am I feeling... angry? disappointed? by the use of time this afternoon? Where does that feeling come from?
  - I think it's a feeling of a lack of control stemming from the feeling that I can't do what I want. It's not really about the specific things I'm doing today, one of which is very exciting (the ultrasound)!
  - And I think it's related to the feeling that I don't have any time to be productive, which makes me feel bad. But I don't NEED TO BE PRODUCTIVE TODAY. IT WAS NEVER THE GOAL!
  - I don't need to pick up the car today. We can do that tomorrow morning maybe? Or no, I can have them send a shuttle tomorrow to pick me up? Hmm maybe not. That meeting tomorrow ends at 9:30. I can try and have them pick me up after then.
- I was just thinking that the reason I wanted to be rich was to have freedom, and now that I'm rich I still don't feel free. But the truth is I AM FREE, I just fixate on the things tying me down rather than recognizing all of the times that I made my own choices. I'm not recognizing and reflecting on all of the choices I make. Like this morning, I bought the stuff for the computer I wanted to build, I played with my new controllers, I ordered a new charger to improve my office. Etc. Hell, I decided to just watch youtube this morning rather than actually doing work. These are all things I CHOSE to do. So what if I have a few things I have to do that aren't entirely my choice, that's life bucko.
- Saw the baby! Everything seems normal and the odds of things like downs decreased after they did some measurements and stuff. So baby seems healthy.
  - Got a bit of a headache while there and it's stuck around. Took some CBD:CBN to help relax a bit, especially as I'm going to the show.
- Also picked up my car, Sarah went shopping after, and she's coming back with the dog.
- Was thinking on the drive there, once again, that part of the reason I don't program at the computer is because the ideas I have while walking (or in this case driving somewhere) aren't actionable. They're me reiterating my understanding of a problem, but I should just be writing those out. The thing is, while I'm thinking about programming, it's not things that I can actually program. So I'm feeling bad about the wrong thing. Not to mention that walking and thinking about computers is very different from actually doing stuff with them.
- It also occurred to me that part of the reason why I feel like I really need to own my time is that with a baby coming it feels a bit like I have a looming deadline where I won't be in control of my time AT ALL, and what little time I have would be dedicated to work on things like PS or Rembrandt and I'm afraid that I won't have any time for myself. And so that's driving me to want to maximize my free time right now.
- Another more fun idea I had was that with all of these shows and movies I want to watch, I should make a bigger deal out of them. Like book them on the calendar as "this is what I'm going to watch tonight". Like make an event out of them ahead of time. 1) I could invite Will over for some, and 2) it'd help combat the thing where Sarah's like "I don't want to watch that". That is my response would be "too bad, I've been planning on watching that and booked it in the calendar and everything".
  - It reminds me of how when I was a kid, I'd make paper trophies for when I won stuff in Mario Kart. Lol. It's making things into an event.
  - Honestly, the nice thing about a calendar I guess is that you can reframe things as "events" and make it more deliberate. Would probably make it feel like I was actually doing things rather than just fucking around.
- This came up on HN today and I just read it: https://ntietz.com/blog/write-more-useless-software/
  - Really resonates with how I've been feeling about software. I haven't been having FUN with it.
  - Like one of the reasons I like going through the books on Lisp is that they're FUN.
  - And it reminds me how as a child I'd just fuck around with ResEdit and pretend as if I was releasing my own versions of software. Or like drawing UIs for operating systems.
  - And you know, maybe instead of starting with the code (which I seem to jump to), I should just write like pretend manuals for the software I want, and who knows, maybe it'll become real?
  - It gets to the idea from Visa about "joking about the things you want to see more of". It's a reframing of things to be more playful. It's just a joke man. Haha. Totally not a real thing.
    - I think I understand this framing a lot more now.
  - The comments: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37911900
    - "I absolutely agree. I went to clown school recently (thats a whole story) and I realised I've been focusing way too much on trying to get projects 'right' or 'do them well'. This is really silly. Life is for living, and I squeeze the fun out of software when I try too hard to do it 'right'." - This is me TO A T!
  - And yea the perfectionism is definitely holding me back, but I think what I'm lacking is the actual fucking around with things AROUND code. I take it seriously, and then think that you need code to be serious, but really I'm jumping past the exploratory phase.
    - It's almost like I've internalized a negative self-image of being an ideas guy. Like idea guys are a joke who don't actually do anything, and the only thing that matters is code. But then the idea isn't actually well formed enough to actually DO ANYTHING ABOUT IT.
  - So my take away here is that I should be writing the manual that I want. The code will come about naturally from there. (Code just being a formalization of my understanding).
  - And the perfectionism stems from the feeling that I'll be rejected for not doing something perfectly. But, it's just a prank bro, why so serious bro???
  - Also gets into why writing software for old computers is so enjoyable to people. It's not something you'll make money off of! But it's FUN.
  - I don't need to work for money anymore. There's no reason anything I do has to be serious. Everything I do is decidedly not serious.
  - That's actually why I want to take a sabbatical. It's giving myself permission to be un-serious and just have fun.
  - So what do I do about this? What happens when I get out of bed tomorrow morning and think about my day?
    1) Meditate
    2) Just do something. Anything but twitter. Play a game. Read a book.
  - Random idea. Make my own porn site, but like, for my own stuff. Pornhub is annoying, I should be able to download it, and like, swipe through things to watch.
    - I'll have SO MUCH STORAGE. I can just download videos and add them to like a queue. Have like a little firefox plugin that I can press to send to the system for download.
  - Oooo, that's a good idea. I'm looking at another thing from HN about Build your own BitTorrent, and the author is in the comments saying that he went through all of the existing ones and really enjoyed it. And it might be cool to make my own Lisp as essentially a book on how to make it. Start with the intent that other people can follow along. https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37941075
    - Actually, I should go through this. I essentially want to implement a similar thing anyways.
    - Ooo, same with the Git one.
  - It'd be cool to make my own Leetcode sort of site. Where I can put the problems I want to try and use that myself.
- 15min to the theatre, show is at 7:30, we should aim to be there early though to order.

* October 18th, 2023
- Reached out to Mercedes, and also CAA to get my membership connected to the MyAMA account. So dumb.
- Went back to the bonus room and watched some youtube and looked at Twitter. I should just do that more often, though really I think I should start playing games again.
- Will just pinged me that Daniel had a coding question, so to work! Time for some fox ears.
  - Of course the dog fucking starts barking when Sarah's in a meeting...
  - You know, I wonder if LispWorks has refactorings like extract function.
- I think I'm gonna order the Pro Controllers for the Quest. In part because I can use them with both the Quest 2 and 3, and I think they'd be good for beat saber. I think I'd like to keep using the Quest 2 for exercise with beat saber since I get so sweaty, and it'd be nice to keep the 3 cleaner.
- Hmm, maybe I should take the dog for a walk, then do some meditation, then figure out what to work on today. I think I should be doing some stuff for Rembrandt, specifically doing some research on CFFI.
  - That's probably a good idea generally. Stand up. Chill for a bit. Walk dog. Program/work/whatever. Then when bored and need something else to do, do some beat saber, do some more work, then work out.
- I need a quicker shortcut to swap between windows in emacs.
  - Actually in general it'd be nice to clean up all of the window management stuff a bit.
- Back from the walk. Blister opened up again. It's odd that it's just on the left. From feeling in the boot, it looks like the seam in the left is a bit rougher than its mirror in the right. Not sure if I can really wear it down at all or not. Not sure what I'd do.
- Ok, meditated, this time was tougher than yesterday. My mind kept wandering. Though as Dr. K. says, that's a good thing. I'm practicing reigning my mind back in. Also need to switch my alarm noise, it's really jarring.
- Ah Mobile Solutions finally got back to me. No CarPlay systems for my car. :(
- My credit card cycle is up tomorrow, I should start looking at ordering stuff for the NAS. Good thing I have all of that money coming in next month...
- Okie, dokie. I need to set up a project for trying out CFFI, mmap, etc. Once again, I forget how to create a project.
- Well that's annoying. The example I found for interop with C has broken code on its site (as in, the code seems to have characters missing in it?). So gotta try something else.
  - Ah, well I suppose I could follow the CFFI tutorial itself.
  - Although this seems like a good tutorial, I'm realizing that it's probably not really the depth that I need. I'm not really looking to wrap a library. What I want to do is use a pointer as an array.
  - So really, I should just be fucking around with mmap.
  - It might be fruitful to look at the code for static-vectors and fast-io. What are they doing?
  - Actually, same with one-more-re-nightmare. It looks at bytes and is designed for use with SIMD.
    - Hmm, it seems to define the primitive ops itself. But then again, I think it just ends up being a function call for them.
    - Maybe the SB-SIMD has examples that work on vectors?
  - Looks like the examples in SB-SIMD use simple-arrays, at least that's how they declare them. I suppose that makes sense, but can you use MMAP the same way?
  - The compiler seems to have compiler macros to deal with mem-ref.
  - I think the hard part right now is just that I can't really test this on this machine. I think I need to try stuff out on Nebula.
- Hmm.
- Feeling kind of bad right now. Don't know what it is. Part of it I think is that I'm now ticked off by PS because Brian just said that my solution is wrong, so I wrote out a large response asking why it's wrong because he essentially said that the bad behaviour is good behaviour.
  - Like, I'm not writing more fucking spaghetti code. Fuck that.
- I think I should order the new floor mat, this one is driving me nuts. Also might go ahead and order that leather chair. And the Quest Pro controllers.
  - Meh, I'll do the chair, desk shelf, and side drawers next month. No rush on those. But I've ordered the floor mat.
  - And ordered the Quest Pro controllers. People say they overheat on them, but I don't know how hot my hands get (especially since I mostly do shit in the basement anyways).
- Oh, I need to figure out how to split the costs of furniture with Sarah. So I'll do that next.
  - Alright did that.
- I hate this stupid fucking company so fucking much.
  - Alright, fixed it again...
- What do now?
  - https://twitter.com/visakanv/status/1402699130695159809
  - "to keep going you have to know your motivations. you have to know your WHY. WHY are you doing this? what is it all FOR? it helps to examine your own life to see what are the things you've cared about in the past. ask your friends & family what got you passionate riled up the most"
  - I think I should read more of his book.
  - "1. lots of people don't know what they want, don't really try very hard to figure out what they want, don't really believe it's possible, if they try they aren't very systematic about it, or they try too hard and agonize about it unproductively, many ways to fail on this front"
  - "2. suppose you don't fail too hard on (1)- you have some sense of what you want, cool. lots of people then aren't very persistent about translating this into manageable projects and actions. some might come up with a big grand plan that's insurmountable, like 'write epic novel'"
  - "3. suppose you did ok with (2)! people will always find ways to fail. they're like, ok, 'become good writer, by writing a lot, write some tweets everyday, a blogpost every week' - pretty good... but then they struggle with managing their psychology/emotions and get jaded"
  - "managing your psychology is basically THE HARD PROBLEM in LIFE. (h/t Ben Horowitz's the hard thing about hard things) everything else is pressing buttons and pulling levers. a novel is one word after another. a marathon is one foot in front of the other. but how to keep going?"
  - I should re-read through hackers and painters too.
- Don't confuse the scaffolding for the building.
  - That's what comes to mind when I think about emacs.
  - You need scaffolding for the projects. But it's not the product.
  - But sometimes I feel like I'm spending too much time on the scaffolding.
  - What's the heuristic I can use to manage this? Really, if something is REALLY annoying me, or it's something I keep wishing I had, I should fix it.
- I should be planning out the build for the NAS. I can do this pretty soon actually.
- Oh, actually, I need to call CAA.
  - Alright, so confirmed that I can login now. I've also downloaded the app which lets me have a digital version of the membership card (in particular, I can add it to my apple wallet).
  - Otherwise, things are good to go, so I should just call them now and get it over with.
  - Okay, request is in. Says I'll be serviced by 9:24pm lmao. The site said about 1h15m wait times. So we'll see! Anyways, I'll receive texts with status updates.
- What's holding me up from trying CL on Nebula? It's ready to go... Maybe it's because of Guix for package management and I feel like I'm gonna have to spend a stupid amount of time fucking around with it.
- Let's read INTROSPECT some more:
  - "I believe it's possible to get to a state where you want what you want, and you do enjoy getting what you want, and it does mean something to you, and after you get what you want, you move on to wanting new and different things, in a way that is additive, wholesome, nourishing rather than empty and tasteless like how the 'hedonic treadmill' feels."
    - The thing is, I buy all of these toys, and I think they do make me happy. It's like collecting. I like keeping interesting objects and products.
  - While reading that passage it crossed my mind (again) that perhaps my motivations and aspirations are more about what other people would find virtuous or commendable rather than what I actually care about.
    - His advice is to "do a bunch of little things that you want. Do lots of little random things and pay attention to how you feel about it. And then work with that. A lightbulb moment I had recently while editing this book is that you don't actually need to 'Know' what you want, in order to do what you want. Children certainly don't! Thes just do what they want! The problem is that we get inside our own heads. We force ouurselves to justify ourselves."
  - Lol, I dreamt of having freedom, and now that I have it, I keep myself bound and chained.
  - "The fear of being seen as a burdensome member of the community instead of a productive one." - The context of this quote is around asking for help, but it resonates for me in that a lot of the shame I feel about having wealth comes from feeling like a leach on society now. Like I have to prove my worth, when the reality is rather different which is that my wealth is downstream from PROVIDING VALUE TO PEOPLE.
  - Do I feel worthy of love and belonging?
    - I don't think I do...
    - So much of my internal anguish is that I feel like I'm letting people down by not being productive. Not being a good partner. Not being a good business partner. Not being a good student.
    - Like, if you read what I'm writing, it seems like everything is conditional. And I think that's what hurt so much about Sarah with the house. It feels like everything was conditional.
    - And maybe that's why I hate receiving gifts and prefer giving them. Deep down I don't think I deserve them. Especially anymore. Why would someone give me a gift?
    - How do I cultivate a sense of self-compassion?
  - Do I actually like coding? It's an interesting question. I almost never get inspired to just sit down and start coding something. I mostly think about it while doing other things. In fact, maybe I just aspire to it because it feels like something I should want to like doing.
  - I think I've always been more interested in reading about programming than actually programming. And I wonder why that is?
  - Part of it might also be that coding is the job of ruthlessly clarifying your problems. And fuck, that's obviously hard. So why beat myself up about it.
  - And if that's really hard, maybe I need to think about how to make it EASY.
- Truck took my car away. That was pretty quick.
- Maybe I've been approaching programming all wrong then. If I like writing, I should start by writing out what I want, and then iterate down to code.
  - In that case, yea it obviously makes sense to work on my blog essentially. Since it's just the start of it. And I can work on emacs code to help me transform stuff.
  - Like, org-mode is cool, but it's kind of hard to use because it's a full toolkit and philosophy, and really I feel like I have my own philosophy that I want to express, so I want to build it out instead.
- I'm definitely a bit afraid of having relations with men in that having sex with another guy is a direct comparison. And since I've traditionally been self-conscious about my body, why would I open myself up to direct ridicule? Or rather, feeling bad about myself.
  - Like, same reason why I don't take nude pictures of myself. The reason I always gave to myself was that I wouldn't want them accidentally leaked. But that's because of fear of ridicule from other people seeing them!
- It's ridiculous to feel like a failure or that you're irrelevant when you've accomplished in 10 years what most people will never achieve in a life time.
- "If you get in the habit of celebrating wins, subconsciously, you’ll get in the habit of winning more, too."
- "Some people overlook, diminish and underplay their wins. This is a recipe for a pessimistic outlook. Don’t do this."
- "Celebrating your wins is an important part of managing your psychology."
- Yeaaaaa. I definitely am not very good at celebrating my wins. I have a tendency to see things as obvious, or needing to be done.
- Time for gym.
- I probably put off buying all these toys and things because I felt I was going to squander my wealth, or become too attached to them without them actually giving me joy, but by not indulging in those things, I was putting off essentially celebrating my success.

* October 17th, 2023
- Alright, family dropped off at the airport.
- Then went to K&W Audio to listen to speakers. Looks like I'll be going for the Paradigm ones (the most expensive lol). On the other hand, I'll be going for a Cirrus screen. The difference between it and the more expensive one wasn't really noticeable. The more expensive one was perhaps ever so slightly brighter, but it was really hard to tell. At least, not worth the $3000 difference as far as I'm concerned. Anyways, total will probably be north of $40K then. Although, speakers won't be available until November 3rd since that's when the sale is. I mean, that's only 2 weeks away though. We'll need to order our furniture from Ikea too.
- The Quest 3 finally came yesterday! UPS doesn't get to our place until around 8pm though lol. Anyways, tried it out and wow, pretty fucking cool. The lenses and higher res displays are so nice, everything is so clear. And the new controllers feel really nice too, especially the haptics which are a lot more subtle. It's also really cool to have passthrough mode with colour, you can actually walk around and see shit. Like I could look at my phone, it obviously wasn't crystal clear and small text would be hard to read, but I could get the gist of it! Oh, and something else that was really cool was that you don't need to actually draw a boundary area, it essentially reads the room for you and draws one.
  - The docking station is nice, although it was a bit fiddly to get the headset to connect and start charging properly.
  - Because of pass through and the dock, I think I'm gonna keep it up here.
  - Need to try some porn on it.
- Ok, so today I have to do something for PS, there's some ticket about focus traps again that's blocking the messenger team lmao. But should probably eat first, then do a bit of meditation.
- Ok, time to walk the dog.
- Back from walking the dog. Just showered and shaved too. Time to meditate.
  - Ahhhh.
- Here's the plan for the day. First thing's first, look at the PS ticket to see what that's all about. Hopefully doesn't take all that long.
  - After that. Not so sure. Maybe I should just work on that, and then meditate again and think about what I want to do for the rest of the day.
  - Once again, they said it was focus trap related but it was someone else's stupid code. The removePopper was set as capture mode instead of bubbling, so it was the first thing that would fire. I.e. it'd always remove the popper before any other event handlers would fire, so they wouldn't actually fire. Stupid.
- Now chatting with Will and Daniel about data storage. I guess all SPX data is like 23TB of JSON... lmao. Although, compressing that we'd end up at about 2.3TB.
- Ok damn, the porn looks so fucking good on the Quest 3. Like there are still compression artifacts and stuff, but it's wayyyy better.
- Also, I'm not sure how to get to the gay content on SLR. It's like on a separate path, but you can't find it from the main site. It's odd.
- You know, I really have to try out the virtual desktop again. With higher res it should be a lot nicer to use actually.
- Ok, well reopening emacs seems to make menus work again. Very odd.
- "What should I be doing rn?"
  - Great question.
  - What SHOULD I be doing right now?
  - What do I want? What do I need?
  - I'm honestly not that sure.
  - I feel like I should be working, but at the same time now that it's 5, I feel like I shouldn't be.
  - Part of the issue is that I'm not really sure what I'm doing right now, or rather, what I'm building towards.
  - Perhaps I should be writing out what I want from the world.
  - I should actually probably be working out right now. Hmm, maybe tomorrow. Like, I'm gonna be active again today, it'll just be with VR. I can put the weighted vest on to make it more of a work out.
  - Sarah wants to figure out what we're doing for Christmas. Which. Good question.
    - So primary constraint with Christmas is probably the dog and cat actually, having them boarded. God, this would be so much easier without pets.
    - Christmas is on the Monday.
    - We don't want to spend too much time, and honestly, probably better to just rapid fire spend a day or so with all of the main family. Minimize the amount of time we're there.
    - Good news is that we can tell everyone that we don't need presents because we can't fit them all on the flight back. So no need to get us anything.
- I honestly don't know what I want anymore... like, I have all of the cool toys, and I like playing with the cool toys. And that's fun. But what am I working to now?
  - Thoughts: I need to do DIFFERENT things. You won't feel different if you do the same things.
  - I still haven't taken my advice which is to take extended time off and just RELAX. PLAY WITH TOYS.
  - What do I want to create?
- Maybe I should be creating my blog. I keep thinking about it. Would be a good excuse to write some Lisp that transforms trees into HTML.
- I think I've been looking at this all wrong. I've been thinking about writing or doing things "for an audience" when the reality is that I find meaning in understanding things. I always have. The value of writing is first and foremost as a means to clarify my own model of the world and to have an opinion on things. I've been so afraid of having an opinion out of a fear of rejection, but polarity is the fundamental nature of the universe.
  - While playing beat saber I was thinking about how I really want to "understand" sex, and it's something I'm drawn to and am interested in in a way that feels abstract to me. And it occurred to me that I should write about it. What intrigues me about it? What about it feels so alluring? What don't I like about it.
  - I should be expressing judgement, and having an opinion.
- It's notable to me that all discussions on sex boil down to aesthetic or utilitarian. And people tend to view sex from a primarily aesthetic point of view or a utilitarian one and people on either side of that continuum talk past each other.
  - What intrigues me about sex is the aesthetics. Sex is the foundation of all aesthetics.
- I should just be writing essays like PG. Why not? Just choose a topic and write. What's on my mind?
  - I have no advice to give.
- Much of my trepidation in life comes from a fear of expressing myself and my aesthetic for fear of rejection.
  - Like, I worry about what people think when I walk around in cowboy boots and a hat with a vest on. But like, who the fuck cares? Or rather, who cares about the negatives, there are people who resonate with that, and aesthetic expression brings joy to people's lives, even if for a fleeting second.
  - People rejecting an aesthetic choice has more to do with THEM than it does with me.
  - Mundanity brings less joy.
- I have such a deep sense of aesthetic in many things, and doing so brings me joy.
- I won't be comfortable expressing more polarizing ideas if I'm not comfortable expressing myself in the small.
- I need to step out away from the computer and read more books. Books on topics I haven't really read about. The reason I stopped reading isn't because I got bored of reading, I got bored of the topics (because I felt I understood them).
  - When I read something, I need to reflect on it in writing. What else does it make me think of? What is my OPINION.
- I also should just write about things I like. Have I thought about why I like them? Or don't like them?
- My deepest feelings of rejection come from the rejection of my feminine side. It's internalized homophobia.
  - I remember being rejected for having painted my nails, for telling someone what colour of underwear I was wearing. Being called faggot on the street.
  - A sense of embarrassment at being into furry stuff, or coming across as effeminate.
- I was so afraid of being rejected for expressing my sexuality that I didn't show it to ANYONE for years, male or female.
- That I was attracted to both sexes was confusing in that I had no idea how to engage with either. While other people were dating, I was just deeply confused and ashamed of myself, and the longer I put off dating, the harder it became to start.
  - I busied myself with other things.
- And every time Sarah brings up being together forever, or that my ass is hers, it's not so much that I want to sleep with other people, it's that I feel like I've kept a part of me under lock and key for so long, and it terrifies me that I'll never be able to express that part.
- It's like, I can't express joy because the way I do so isn't masculine enough, so I have to be stoic all the time, and it feels so stultifying.
- I've been so afraid of rejection, that I've been rejecting myself this whole time.
- It just feels like such a self-imposed restriction, and if I'd known otherwise a few years ago, I don't know if I'd have stuck with the relationship (or rather, I'd have brought it up earlier and let her decide).
  - There are just so few things I get a feeling of FOMO over, and this is the one, because it's one I've been denying for so long.
- And when it comes to sex, Sarah's just very... vanilla. And not like, oh need to get kinky and try all this new shit. It's that, I don't think I could get her to ever be interested in say, more spiritual/tantric sex. Which to me is about deepening the connection. I just don't see it. And it could be an inability to communicate on my part, but it's just. I don't know. Really discouraging that if I ever express an interest in that, she like writes it off. That's the stuff that I think I'm missing.

* October 16th, 2023
- I'm so fucking annoyed. Hit a pot hole last night just as we were almost home and unseated the tire. AGAIN. So now I have to figure out CAA and book a fucking appointment with Mercedes. I guess at least I can have it in for its annual service... but still. Going to be a few days without the car. And I'll need to take the family to the airport in Sarah's car.
- So signed up for a new account with CAA AMA, the Alberta one. Although I paid for a membership, it's not associated with my new online account... I assume it'll figure itself out in a day or so, if not I'll have to contact them.
- Now I should cancel my old account. And then contact Mercedes.
- Ok, there are still two duplicate charges from Meta. Need to reach out to them too.
  - Waiting on a chat agent.
  - Ok support ticket is 06021108
  - Ah, the charges are correct. It looks like each product was billed separately, and there were two pairs of products with the same prices, so it looked like duplicate charges.
- Just submitted my therapist receipt. Looks like he's in the system for Equitable.
- So just need to cancel my existing CAA membership, and then contact Mercedes.
- I need to add chemicals to the hot tub (weekly maintenance).
- Lol, apparently if you're having troubles debugging something you should put on cat ears. Lean into the furry uber-engineer. Although, it's probably true that changing your exterior appearance and putting on a persona helps transition between mental states. Makes me think that I should do a similar thing when I'm looking to program. Similar to how I've set rules for myself about when to use weed/vyvanse, I can put rules on myself to facilitate specific mental states.
  - I have multitudes, why constrain myself to one self?
  - It's funny, I'm still furry adjacent. But somewhere along the line I saw it as cringe-y, and so I leaned out of it.
  - Also, I think I need to set clear rules with Sarah about when she can disturb me when I'm in my office. I need like a green-light/red-light system. That'd probably go a long way to dealing with the feeling that I'll be disturbed.
  - Doing a green light/red light system would be easy with Hue Bulbs. Just need to set up a light in the hall that's always on and then I can change the colour.
  - Ah good, there's a home widget for the mac too. Just need to be able to set scenes or something. I do have a free lightbulb available. Hmm, there are three in the hallway. I need to check what type of bulb they are though.
  - Well that's dumb. They aren't like a standard bulb, they're literally a custom type of light with integrated LEDs I guess. So need to figure something else out. I mean, I could just get a do not disturb sign.
  - Ah there are some nice ones on Amazon. I guess I can just add some cat ears to the order too lmao.
  - Ordered!
- Alright, time to try and cancel my CAA membership.
- Sarah, Ursula, and Mom are going out shopping. Reid's in the basement. I still need to reach out to Mercedes, but thinking I should probably meditate. Also would be a good time speaking with ChatGPT.
- If I were to take up a writing practice, or rather a more structured writing practice, what would that look like? Kind of goes back to what Mom and Sarah said about how I probably have a lot of interesting things to tell people and advice, but I'm really not so sure.
- Why do I find talking so mentally draining? I guess it's because I don't do it much? Maybe I can practice talking more. Probably a good way to use ChatGPT to be honest.
- Kind of weird that ChatGPT has custom instructions, but only one. The interface would be cooler if you could create "personas" that have different instructions and chat histories.
- Hmm there isn't a note about a limit on number of responses anymore with GPT-4. Oh wait, it's hidden now.
- Good thing that Will upgraded his own account, no longer need to worry about him seeing my chats.
- I think the tough thing I've had with ChatGPT is figuring out the persona to give it. Since I haven't really played around with that too much. I suppose I could just ask it...
  - Part of the problem is probably that don't really know what sorts of personas I want to talk to.
  - Hmm, it gave me some interesting prompts to make it act a certain way, but I think I need to look for other examples of what people have done. I wish there was like a reddit/HN for conversations. I want to read what other people have done.
- I wonder how they're generating voices, it must be some new tech. The other thing is that they have to send the tokens to that model pretty quickly. Though, whisper can run on phones, I wonder how hard it is to run a text-to-speech model...
- How much of modern LLM stuff is about layering abstractions? Like feeding output from one type of network to another? Like I can imagine passes whereby you put something through one system (like think through this problem), and then feed that result to another one to transform the text according to a different persona to change the "voice" of the text.
- It'd be really cool to index everything in emacs to make it retrievable with vector similarity.
- I think I should take the dog for a walk.
- Alright, back from walking the dog. Also topped up the chemicals in the hot tub. Figure we'll do that tonight once more before I send mom home lmao.
- Still waiting on the Quest 3...
- Still need to meditate today! Why am I avoiding it?
- Alright, finally started doing the meditation. First video was Nadi Shuddhi, which is the alternate nostril breathing. You put your hand over your face and use your thumb and pinky alternating closing your nostril. And yea... it feels really calming. By using your hand, it keeps you very focused on doing that, so everything else goes away. And yea, I feel calmer now. He recommends doing that for 3-5min at a time, then sort of sitting with the calm mind for awhile.
  - Very interesting. I think I'm just more used to doing essentially mindfulness, and haven't really considered other forms of meditation like this which distract the mind by doing something else.
  - Ah, there are two more videos that develop that technique, but they're supposed to be done after a few weeks of doing the prior one.
  - I am feeling more calm. Should probably start my day with this TBH.
- So I think emacs overlays are sort of like decorations or nodes in Codemirror. Font Lock mode is for colouring things and is instead more like a mark? Like overlays let you render text that doesn't actually exist in the buffer. Likewise, they let you define keymaps that apply when the point is in the overlay. So they can act like buttons I guess.
- I'm watching this video about creating tic-tac-toe in emacs, and it's pretty straightforward. He's made some choices that don't feel great to me. But the general approach makes sense. It's just setting up a major mode, erasing the board, and re-writing it on an update condition.

- Banff!

- Went to the zoo today! That was fun. But now I'm really tired. I didn't fall asleep until like 2:30 last night. Not sure why. I felt like... too much energy. Like I couldn't settle, and so my mind was thinking, thinking, thinking. But if I tried to just quiet my mind, the energy went to my body instead.
- I got three of the packages from Meta yesterday. They ended up coming earlier than expected. Still need to make sure the duplicate charges were reverted. The last two packages are scheduled for tomorrow... err Monday I meant.
- Every time I think about meditating, I have an internal aversion to doing so. Not sure where that's coming from.
- Once again there was an Aella tweet that made me feel fomo: https://twitter.com/Aella_Girl/status/1713011519905030353 (or rather, these three).
- Oh, bought some cowboy boots yesterday! Will need to break them in.
- Also just checked and I finally have DALLE-3 access. And yet... I don't know what to do with it. Or even what to try with the vision.
- Actually, come to think of it, the reason I don't play with GPT much is probably the same as why I don't interact with other people much... I'm not sure what I'll find interesting to discuss.
- Interesting, request.el uses CURL as its backend. I think that'll be a good thing to read to understand how to interact with processes in emacs in a synchronous fashion.
- I think the other thing I'd like to look at is tetris, to understand how it interacts with like rendering things.
- Dope, got my preferred tabbing behaviour back.
  - Something I'd like to build out next is a quick "jump to journal". Kinda curious how org-roam works tbh. Maybe there are some good videos on it.
  - One thing I'm just realizing with this setup is that org-mode is installed in remacs-packages, and then further configured in remacs-org. Maybe we can consolidate them somewhat?
  - Hmm, I guess we could just use use-package multiple times. I think it "does the right thing". Might actually help to clean up some of the stuff in the hooks.
    - Really, I think it might make more sense to have the modes define functions, and then the config can be more opt in.
- You know what. I think org-mode will probably drive me insane. Might be better to just build my own lmao. I think the issue is that it uses text as the basis, when what I really want is a structural format. It might be better to just have something that can output to org-mode the same way that org-mode can export to HTML.
  - And just do that instead of fucking around trying to figure out how to make org-mode work for me.

* October 13th, 2023
- Huzzah! Electrician is here.
- Man, gotta fix these fucking indentations on org-mode...
- Not much to do today since we were waiting on the electrician. Dog's at daycare, and then I need to pick up meat this afternoon. Also, have a call with Zamal and Will at 2:45. Figure I'll head to pick up the meat this afternoon, and maybe some more veggies to grill. Then come back so that they can come up to room temperature. We can do like an early-ish dinner and then go shopping after that since the mall is open until 9 (and same with Lammle's).
- Need to submit my invoice from the therapist to insurance. Hopefully is covered, that'd save me some money.
- It's interesting... oh. I was just gonna write that I don't see broken icons on this machine compared to Oblivion, but I just got a broken icon here too. I wonder why. Should look it up, since it's Doom modeline. Maybe Berkeley Mono patched with nerd-icons isn't working properly and I can set up a fallback. Also, I noticed that when company pops up, the lines below it move a bit.
  - Ah, needed to call nerd-icons-install-fonts. Should add that to the personalization.
- Just got back from lunch with le family. Now just gonna chat with Will and Zamal. Then installing bidets.
- There's this tweet about how ADHD should be reframed as Intention Deficit Disorder. https://twitter.com/OrphicCapital/status/1712181253456183759
  - And a thought I had with this is that I think that's part of the issue I have with stand up at 8:30, and then having to handle the dog before that. My mornings are not intentional, they're entirely reactive and so my day starts off as reactive. And I don't have a clear time to think about what my day is going to be about.
  - The other thing is that not only am I not good at articulating my intentions to myself, I'm even worse at articulating them to other people. No wonder I have issues with Sarah around schedule, I never tell her what I want.
  - That kind of leans into that thing about how starting a company is actually about starting a religion. You can't start a religion if you don't tell anyone about it. What's the vision? What's my vision for life?

* October 12th, 2023
- Spent like $600 at Ikea last night lmao. But we did get a bunch of spa robes and slippers which is cool.
- Geoff got back to me with a quote. Range seems to be about $30-45K.
  - So $12,592 for a rack, power stuff, network control system, subwoofers, receiver, audio paneling, cables, and installation.
  - Then, I need to choose screen, projector, and speakers. Speakers will obviously be a bit more based on how they sound/look to me.
  - Screen is either $1800 or $4500. I'm assuming the material on the more expensive screen is better, but is it nearly $3000 better?
  - Projector he put the Epson ($6500), and the JVC I was looking at ($12450). I've more or less decided that the JVC is what I want.
    - Lol, so $25000 for the projector plus the common items. Then it's screen plus speakers after that.
    - I mean, my indemnity escrow payment essentially pays for this entire build more or less. That's nice.
  - Speakers he gave me three options. Totem: $7000, Martin Logan: $8000, Paradigm: $12,840.
  - So, balls to the wall is $42,630 + GST. So about $45K.
    - El cheapo, is $33,842 + GST.
    - So really, comes down to which screen do I get? And which speakers?
  - The Paradigm speakers are similar in price to the L800s.
    - I can always get those later. In fact, those might be better for like, upstairs or something. Since they seem to be more about music experience anyways.
  - I do like that they stock a bunch of Canadian brands.
- Well, I should figure out what I want to do today. Maybe should do some Beat Sabre.
  - There's the emacs stuff that needs done. Like, need to finish off adding the modes back in (specifically CL).
  - And I might want to reorganize everything a bit to make it easier to manage as a repo.
- Alright, did some beat sabre (like 40min) and walked the dog.
  - Need to figure out when to go pick up that 3090Ti. Reached out asking what his address was.
  - Need to also prepare the house a bit.
- On the walk was thinking about interpreter vs translator vs runtime. All that fun stuff. A reader deserializes data using a parser.
  - But since the syntax of Cyfer is so versatile, it's worthwhile to have implementations in many programming languages.
  - Parser takes Text and turns it into a series of tokens. Tokens are classified into various types, and then you just need to provide a function for each type to transform that Text into something meaningful in the host language (constructor for lists, symbol (or rather lookup), etc).
  - Ah, I think part of the problem I had historically with the parser is that I was returning data that I would then transform. What I should be doing is invoking a function! And you know what. That's exactly what PEGs do come to think of it. You describe the set of tokens, and then you have callbacks on them. The data you return from those callbacks is what you get at the end.
  - Tokenization is the process of turning Text into a List of Text. Parsing takes a List of Text and returns a Tree.
- Oh, I think I want to learn more about creating Help style buffers in Emacs Lisp. How do I use Emacs as a UI? Part of this would be to generate my own splash screen for Rembrandt (which could have instructions or common actions).
- It's interesting that DOM elements are essentially typed lists. Or rather, it's kind of like, nobody really uses singly-linked lists, but it's more common to use linked-lists with the pointer stored in the node itself.
  - I think that might be a bit of the issue with Lisp, because it uses external storage for lists, cons gets overloaded for so many things, it's a struct of type Any, Any.
  - Oh, maybe that's why we could call () tuples. [] is a short form for a list. Tuple implies known number of elements. I.e. tuples are fixed size. Tuples are the allocation primitive. And it maps to the fact that the first part of a tuple usually clarifies the Type.
  - We use Tuples to represent code. And no wonder, once serialized, a tuple has a fixed number of elements.
  - Everything is a tuple. [] and {} are just short hands essentially. They'd be interned as Tuple with List or AssociationList respectively.
  - We could have mutable tuples, but definitionally, you can't extend a Tuple, you can only copy their contents.
  - Tuples are generalized cons. Cons typically has two arguments, but why not more?
  - That would also mean that returing multiple values is simpler. You're not returing a List, you're returning a tuple.
  - Only thing is that at a runtime level, you still need to make note of how many elements are in the tuple, but at least for common cases you don't need to. And, with type checking, you can know them statically.
- So I think it might make sense to get rid of no-litter and just do what nano did, because nano seems to work pretty well. Also, maybe need to get rid of auto-dim-other-buffers since it kind of looks like shit if there's fringes. Unless I can somehow have it dim the text instead.
  - Oh, there's a dimmer.el that does it for faces from the looks of it. Let's try that.
  - Ah yea that's better. One thing I just noticed though is that auto-dim-other-buffers handles windows rather than buffers so if you have the same buffer open it works the way you would expect (the active window is highlighted). Dimmer doesn't though, so if you have the same buffer open, they'll both be normal. I wonder if I can make that change myself.
    - Ah, there was an issue on Github and apparently it's a limitation of the API. Face remapping doesn't work for windows, only buffers. Where auto-dim-other-buffers must have set properties on the window, not the text within it. Shame.
- Lol, I just realized. I haven't really had a need to use Oblivion since the bonus room is so close to the office, it makes no sense to just have a computer sitting there. But once I have a theater though! I'll need a theater room laptop lmao.
- My fingerprint has fucking changed again apparently since none of my laptops recognize me today.
- Hmm, I guess a Shield TV Pro is better for Plex because of things like Dolby Vision or whatever. But people say that the Apple TV is better for general streaming.
  - One thing I'm concerned about with the home theater is where to put the game consoles. Since while I could put them in the rack, it would be in another room and I'd worry about the controllers being flakey. Less concerned about going in to insert discs, not a big deal.
  - Hmm, Shield TV Pro is on sale at Visions.ca. Hmm, there are locations in Calgary, but it doesn't show if they're in stock at those locations or not. I suppose I could go look today if this guy responds about the 3090.
- Alright, back to work. What else did I want to do with emacs? I think it was setting up the different modes. Actually, I think I should set this up a bit differently for installing. It'd be nice to have it call out to a different folder for personal stuff. Maybe, let's put everything in the remacs folder, then put a modes folder within that. Then the personal folder can go in like .config/remacs/
  - Okay that's done. I think I like that setup more. So now there's a .config/remacs folder that you need to edit. Time to update the README.org, and then I think I'll get rid of no-littering.
  - Alright, the repo has been reorganized. Time to remove no-littering.
  - Okay dope. No-littering is gone.
  - Now that that's all done. Not sure what to do next. I guess I need to add back Sly. Oh, actually that reminds me, I need to install CL on Oblivion.
  - Hmmmm, maybe I should figure out how to do CL with Nix though. In which case, I think I should start looking at using the new config on this machine instead.
- Alright here goes nothing then! I'll back up my emacs first. Actually, maybe should update my packages and all that.
- Ehhh, new config who dis. Lol, I need to add magit to the config because it's not actually loaded lmao. It must be in the config.org though. Also, I need to get used to the default org keybindings.
  - Hmm, that's odd, when you open a new frame, it has a HUGE titlebar. Well, I should be using windows instead anyways.
  - Alright, time to set up magit. Also need to do some reading on org keys.
  - Sly is set up! Time to commit that shit and PUSH.
- I'm still not sure whether I like the way org handles inserting items. You have to hit M-RET. Likewise, S-TAB toggles the full document, but you kind of want it to toggle opposite way (at least for nested lists). Part of the issue is that M-RET is just really difficult to enter on Moonlander (at least with how I have it currently set up). Well not difficult, it's just an uncommon key sequence for me. I rarely hit enter with anything other than Cmd (which I have on a dedicated button).
- Nice, Amazon is finally out for delivery. Bought some of those prism glasses so that you can look at the TV while lying completely flat lmao.
- Seems to be that I have about an hour or so of work time in me per day. Once I hit that point I start fucking around.
- In the spirit of Emacs, I think I need to customize the org shortcuts to actually work for me. A lot of them are rather obtuse.
- Another thing I need to add to emacs is the ability to go back to a previous window configuration to deal with the stupid windows that pop up occasionally.
    
* October 11th, 2023
- Rainy day here today. Ooo, weather's looking good for the weekend actually.
- Today I have a fucking sprint retro from 9-10. What a stupid fucking meeting.
- Otherwise, I have to quickly address some code review comments today. Then I have the day for my own shit.
- I have a 1-1 with Daniel at 1pm too. That'll be fun.
- Occurs to me that I need to update my location on a bunch of subscription services since my tax should come down. Lol, had to cancel and resubscribe to Game Pass for the tax to update. Time to update PSN, although it's billed annually.
- A cinema aspect ratio screen would allow for a larger screen than 16:9. Like, just geometry means that we could get a screen of the same height, and 16:9 content would just be bounded by boxes on the sides. So I wonder if it makes sense to go for like a 150" cinema screen rather than a 120" 16:9 one since the 16:9 one would literally fit inside it. The difference is about 34" in width. So, just under a foot and a half on each side. That way, you'd get the all consuming size of the screen for movies, with the same experience for ordinary content.
  - Sadly the Series X does not support HDR10+ for 4K blurays apparently. Eh, but I don't know if it'd make sense to get a dedicated Blu-ray player unless I had a lot of discs. Also, might be able to get that out of a PC anyways.
- Was thinking just now that since I had such a good time breaking out the stuff to do for Rembrandt into tasks/projects, I should do the same for Cyfer. I think what usually happens is that I'll start planning, then get inspired to start coding, and as such not finish planning. But I should more realistically set out my plan for it and what are the actual necessities. Another issue was that I'd start yak shaving on things that weren't necessary at first, like starting on an editor for the language instead of just working on the language. So I need to make that clear as well. What parts are the project, and what parts are tooling for the project.
  - I think the reason this has become top of mind again is that I'll be building out a NAS, and so I'll have computers to manage that are "far away" (i.e. I don't want to have to run to the basement constantly). The other is that with a NAS, I have a place to backup and store a LOT of data. Add to that Daniel's NAS, and I have a reason to try out things like replication.
  - This also stems from stuff that I consider fun. Like, a lot of this is projects that I've always thought about doing, I just never had the follow through to connect them all.
  - And a nice side effect of all of this with Rembrandt is 1) I'll be using the same tooling, so work I do for myself is work for the company, 2) I now have Daniel enlisted in the Ryan sphere of technical influence LMAO, and 3) I'll be exploring aspects of the SBCL compiler toolchain that are things I'd be interested in implementing myself. It's interesting that we'll be doing rather low-level stuff, stuff that'll help me when it does come time to implement my own operating system for instance.
- So, first thing's first. I need to address the code review feedback so that I have that all checked off for today. Then I'll start planning my own work.
  - I should also bring in some of the config from this blog post on emacs defaults that came up on HN today: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37843908
  - I think part of the greater planning also comes down to promotion, and by that I mean more religion building. How do I convey what the project is all about? How do I find like minded people to work on it?
- Where should I keep this plan? Notion had them in separate pages which was cool.
- Wondering if we should try org-roam in the config. Reminds me that I need to start work on that README.org.
- Alright, did some VR. Time to think!
  - Need to continue with the meditation modules though. In particular, need to do some of the actual meditation videos.
- Reading this thread (https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37833278) and it reminds me of a thought I had way back about how if you have a programming language with an associated token, you can use those tokens as bounties to develop libraries for the language (with a lack of libraries being one of the main reasons languages stay niche). That thread is also good because it talks about Scheme (or Guile particularly) in the browser with WASM (and WASM's new GC reference types allowing the GC of the browser to take care of GC for WASM code). Both very relevant topics to me.
- Interesting comment in another thread about the distinction between a namespace and a package: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37843550
  - I guess he says that packages are really just symbol tables. They map names to symbols.
  - His point seems to be that namespaces (at least as they are talked about in CL) are mappings from symbols to functions/variables/tags/etc. Whereas a package is a mapping from strings to symbols (which themselves have a name, which is a string). I think this gets into the issues Rich Hickey had with packages and why they are different in Clojure.
    - He doesn't really explain this well in the initial comment, but he clarifies it later.
  - So when naming things, think about what the mappings imply. Hence why I've been thinking more along the lines of Dictionary instead of package or namespace.
  - From that frame of reference, then it makes a bit more sense to me what identifiers are. Identifiers are something that happens in the reader, the reader takes identifiers and replaces them with an actual object of some sort.
  - That's perhaps why I prefer symbol (rather than keyword) as the name for things like :test (in the fashion of Ruby). Symbols stand for themselves. Meanwhile, identifiers are more like words. They stand in for something else (the thing they denote in the given context).
    - Also separates symbols from the notion of a place that holds a value.
    - Ah, so like source code denotes things, but then the environment is what holds the value as exists at a given time.
    - Hence why Clojure uses Vars to actually hold things. Vars are SINGLETON OBJECTS.
- Hmm, this has me thinking about Cyfer a lot actually.
  - I think a lot of my inner thoughts have been about trying to assuage the ideas of people aren't likely to be in my camp anyways. So I should just ignore those and focus on people who could come to my way of thinking. I.e. I should just be building this shit for Daniel and maybe Devin/Chris as secondary targets.
  - So there are a few layers to building a system like this. I think I've been caught up on how to approach them.
  - On the one hand you have the runtime. This is actually the part that is the hardest to build since it's an ever evolving piece of software for performance reasons. This is essentially the "operating system" or rather the implementation of an environment. There are a few ways I could go about this:
    - First is to build an interpreter. Second is to build a transpiler (to Common Lisp first, but Scheme or JS would be good targets).
    - Now that I've written it out that way, it's essentially a tower where I can replace the underlying pieces bit by bit. Treat the implementation language as scaffolding to be replaced. You start with an interpreter, then a transpiler, then an implementation in an unmanaged environment (C/Unix), then an implementation on bare metal. Each part of that puzzle getting tougher as you go, in part because you'd need to think about interacting with outside code, and implementing a garbage collector, etc.
    - But either way, should start with an interpreter since that would act as your reference implementation.
  - Above the runtime is the reader/printer which is really just an interface. As much as I'd like to implement the reader/parser within the language, obviously I can't do that just yet. So I have to write it in CL or whatever the host environment's language is. Once I have an interpreter though, then I can write a reference implementation. (Likewise for the printer).
  - At least if I use CL or Scheme, a lot of that code would end up looking pretty similar, so I can rip of and duplicate a bunch of stuff (from myself).
  - Now where I seem to run into problems is that I'm rather excited by the stuff with hashing/merkleization, but that's actually all at the runtime layer! And rather deep at that. Since that should actually come after the we have an interpreter, and notably, once we essentially want the equivalent of files. Persistence is definitionally a part of the runtime environment. Likewise all of the stuff about networking and replication. All of that comes later.
  - Between the runtime and the reader sits the actual language. That is, what syntax is there. What are the keywords? How do literals work? That is, all of the semantics that bridge the runtime to the reader. And I think that gap is something I've felt really unsure about compared to the other layers. I think it's because semantics are harder to change once you're actively using the thing. But it doesn't have to be.
    - The main thing I need to do is rip off and duplicate the stuff from each of Scheme, Common Lisp, and Clojure that I care for the most. Now that I have a Scheme reference, I can take a lot of stuff straight from that reference.
    - A lot of what I like with CL is more about runtime specific things, so I can leave that until later.
    - And likewise, what I like most about Clojure is stuff like vector and map literals. Those can also come later (since they're mostly just syntactic sugar for (Map ...) and (Vector ...)).
    - We'll start out in a rather untyped fashion.
    - And we can write CyferScript in text files and store them in Git for now until the day comes that we can persist it natively in a self-replicating runtime environment.
  - I'll definitely want tooling in Emacs for this. At least that can come later, and I have other tasks with Rembrandt that should get me more familiar with those areas I'm likely to touch. CyferScript will just be a derived mode of the shared Lisp stuff. Then I'd need to look at sending stuff to a remote process (either via Sly directly), which I'll be interested in doing with Rembrandt too.
- Fucking dog is fucking insane. Running around in the rain like a lunatic. Ripping me back and forth doing zoomies in the mud.
- 1-1 with Daniel in a few minutes, then need to wrap up the stuff for PS since Brian got back to me.
- One thing I'm not sure about how to handle is the feeling of being in waiting mode, or that whole thing about how even if I have 20min until something, I feel like I can't do anything meaningful. What is that about?
  - Part of it is definitely that I have a hard time context switching, and so I don't want to do a high-effort thing that'll need to be interupted.
  - Another could be that I don't want to accidentally miss the upcoming thing because I've gotten too deep on the in-between thing.
    - That definitely is a problem for like, if I want to play video games. You never know when a cut-scene or something is going to start, or a sequence that you can't pause or skip.
  - Reading a bit about this and it talks about how waiting mode is similar to ruminating (a thought pattern where our mind focuses on a distressing situation and continues to return to it even after being pulled away). And you know, yea, that's something I deal with a lot actually. And I think counterintuitively, I think one source of waiting mode is that I don't want to enter into a state where I'm ruminating on the task that I'm doing before the scheduled one.
  - I just really don't like being interrupted I think. I find it really hard to deal with. And so I don't like starting things if I KNOW I'm going to be interrupted by something. Scheduled meetings are just scheduled interruptions.
  - And it's also why I have a negative response to when Sarah wants to introduce things to the evening if I haven't thought of them. I see it as an intrusion on the intention of my evening.
  - I definitely do this as a result of realizing that I have a hard time switching from things I get into a flow state with. Like I couldn't code at work because if I had a 1-1 or something, I'd still be thinking about the code in the meeting. It's really hard to turn that off and move on.
  - Also, really annoying to do things when I'm expecting someone at sometime. Literally happened yesterday with Geoff, I JUST started a workout since I hadn't heard from him, and BOOM doorbell rings.
  - And all of that together makes it hard to do things during the day, because part of me expects that at any moment the dog is gonna do something, or Sarah is going to drop in...
- I definitely need to get more comfortable with writing things in Emacs, as I was thinking more about Cyfer, I realize I'm gonna want to cordon the Cyfer stuff off, even if it's running in CL and I have SLY connected, I'm gonna want to write and read stuff in Emacs with Cyfer syntax.
- I should record some of the other things I remember from childhood that I think are autistic behaviours. For instance, getting really worked up when someone broke something of mine, or put things out of order. The fact that I carried a portfolio around? (I don't even remember doing this, but my mom and my aunt both talk about it).
- Okay, have the beginnings of a README.org in place. Still need to pull some of the stuff from that blog post today. Also added tasks for setting up SLY, and Org-mode. Also assigned the task of creating EVIL mode bindings to Daniel.
  - The other thing I want to do is bring some of the stylistic changes from Nano over. I really like how well Nano breathes.
- Alright, PS stuff is done.
- OMG, finally figured out how to have recently closed files appear in the switch-buffer minibuffer. The setting is called ivy-use-virtual-buffers which should be set to t.
  - Hmm, they still aren't saving across sessions for some reason.
  - Ah, no-littering changes the variable and that was loaded after recentf was. So I made it load first, and boom, good shit.
  - I need to figure out why the auto-dim-other-buffers looks like shit still. I think it has to do with the fringe that shows on wrap around.
- Well, I feel alright about what I worked on. I pulled in a bunch of random stuff from Nano, and figured out the issue with recentf (which while annoying, I use a LOT). Next up is configuring the rest of the major modes, CL really. Since once those are in order, I can more or less think about trashing this specific configuration and then using the Remacs one full time essentially. It'll also be a good way for me to stress test user configuration since I'll be the first to use my own features and what not. Realistically, I think I'll end up changing the installation instructions so that I can have Remacs working alongside my personalizations in separate repositories.
- Well, need to go to Ikea and get groceries. Also should turn the heat on in here. It's coldddd.

* October 10th, 2023
- Big day today. Lots of stuff on the calendar.
  - Had weekly catch up with Will/Daniel, then I have a 1-1 with Jonathan, then my therapist. Also, hasn't been confirmed yet, but I asked K&W to come today, we'll see if he responds.
- Gotta remember to take out the garbage at night. I got the garbage out before the truck got here, but he was literally two houses down when I did LMAO.
- Fucking dog keeps barking.
- Oh man, I was playing Tiny Tina's Wonderland yesterday. Pretty fun. I like the art direction. Villain is voiced by Will Arnett.
- Fleshlight delivery is expected today which is cool.
- I need to book a 1-1 with Daniel. He was saying as a result of the automation meeting he had with Will that he realized the automation software should share the same language interface as the back tester. And yea, that makes a lot of sense. So we need to define that really. I think part of the issue with options is that they're derivative securities, but we need to implement stuff for underlying as well. So really, should start by setting up automation/backtesting for stocks. And then options get layered on top.
  - And that would be a really cool system actually. I'd totally use that language for exploring data. Make emacs into a Bloomberg terminal essentially.
  - Like, I should be able to load information about a stock, and the stocks should just be their tickers on the exchange. Each exchange could be a package.
- There's a water cooled 3090Ti on FB Marketplace at the moment for $1400. I might ask about buying that actually. It's a 2-slotter. Not sure if I'd need another 3090Ti though if I ever want to NVLink them. But at least it'd fit with room for an HBA in the other slot. I could do another 3090 with just fans and fit that in. It's not like they'd be running super hot I think, LLMs are more about memory than compute.
- Damn, ExLLaMA has a 4090 + 3090 Ti doing about 17token/sec on LLaMA 2 70B (must be 4bit quantization, since that's only 40GB of VRAM, really shows that you want dual 48GB cards though).
- So therapist is about 30min away. 25min drive, but then I need to figure out parking and what not. So leave appointment is at 2pm, that means like around 1:15-1:20ish?
- Need to pay the electrician. Also need to take out cash today (to pay him on Friday).
- Sadly, I need to do some work today...
- Also sadly looks like the Quest 3 stuff is coming later than anticipated. Delivery is now closer to the 20th or 21st. Accessories still coming a bit earlier. Oh weird, they're actually all over the place:
  - Quest 3: Oct 18
  - Quest 3 Elite Strap with Battery: Oct 20
  - Quest 3 Charging Dock: Oct 20
  - Quest 3 Active Straps: Oct 18
  - Quest 3 Silicone Facial Interface: Oct 26
  - So the accessories are actually coming later.
- Hmm, I don't think I can actually do breakfast with Will tomorrow. Fucking sprint retro then.
- Well, I kind of want to do some VR. Get my work out in. Also will need to walk the dog at some point. And then, I do need to do some work for PS since the sprint ends tomorrow. At the same time, I do want to get some of my own stuff out of the way as well. But not sure what that'll be. Oh, should follow up with Geoff to see if today still works.
- Ok, let's do some VR, then I guess I'll do some work on PS to get it out of the way.
  - Well, had to stop early cause the dog was barking and Sarah was in a meeting. Took her for a walk and she pooped, but she also had insane zoomies. So much fucking energy that dog.
- Fleshlight delivery should be soon. I saw the Canada Post guy while on my walk, he just hasn't made it to our box yet.
- Before I go to the therapist, I should take note of some of the things I want to talk about. I feel like there are some that I've written down here.
- Time for some PS work though.
  - Ok, that's done.
- Hmm. Canada Post came and went, but no package. It's listed as out for delivery though. Tres weird.
- I'm out of random lunches. Need to buy some more.
- The water cooled 3090Ti is still available. I'll follow up when I'm home about coming to see it.
  - Hmmm, it seems like the card is rather tall because of the water cooling block.
  - Based on dimensions, it might just fit. But it'd be tight. Worse case scenario, just leave the case open? Lmao. Or I could put it as a second card in Hyperion.
- WTF, it's been rescheduled for delivery tomorrow...
  - Oh, Canada Post guy is back!
  - So interestingly, the alien texture didn't come with a tube in it like the others. It's also sort of tacky feeling, like it hasn't had the renewing powder (aka corn starch) applied. So maybe should do that first?
  - The blow dryer thing looks like it'll work well. The warmer also apparently takes only 6-9 minutes. So want to give that a shot.
- So therapist seems decent. Next one is booked for the 24th, exactly 2 weeks. I think we covered a lot of the context today, so I should bring some more specific things I want to talk about next time.
- Still haven't heard from Geoff after sending my address and number. So... not sure if he's coming out today or not?
- I'm sitting here thinking "what am I supposed to do right now?" and really I think I should be working out. So let's do that.
- I also want to make a list of the stuff I'll be buying for the NAS. Will be fun to assemble links for all of that. Probably should go for a Seasonic power supply this time around.
- Lol, was just starting my workout and Geoff showed up lol. So, he thinks it'll be a good space. He'll send me a quote with a few different options I guess. And then the next main thing I'll be doing is going in to listen to various speakers.
- Ok, this Fleshlight air dryer is pretty dope lol. There are three settings, which apparently are for 20min, 40min, and 60min respectively. Pretty cool. Gonna have to try out the warmer tonight.
- Can't believe I'm building another beast PC in such a short time. Good thing the drives and HBA can come later. It'll boot from an SSD afterall.
  - Hmm, I'll probably need a 1500W PSU... you'd need a 1300W one just for two cards, but that doesn't include all of the HDDs.  Ok, so a hard drive is 15W (on the high end), that'd mean 180W for 12 drives. So yea, 1500W. At least it won't be an Intel CPU driving this fucker.
  - Ah, Seagate puts 9.6W as the max operating wattage of an Exos drive. 5.4W idle. This thing is gonna idle at like a stupid amount of watts.
- Gotta remember to take out the blue bin and green bin tonight before bed.

* October 9th, 2023
- Lots of fun hanging with the guys last night. Played with the miniature pool and air hockey tables lol. Then we were in the hot tub for awhile. I should check the chemicals again before going in tonight. I added a bit of the foam away, since we started getting some bubbles forming.
- Just took the dog for a walk. Thinking today will just be gaming.
- Honestly, I think if I do decide to keep working, I'd rather do 3 day weekends regularly. It's nice to get stuff out of the way for cleaning/house maintenance on one day, and then still have two days in the week to do fuck all. It'd also focus the other days of the week more.
  - Should do some Beat Saber today and maybe some weights. We'll see.
- I think I need to stay off of twitter for a bit. My mind keeps coming back to the stuff happening in Israel (and the stupidity all around that topic). I should do some Beat Saber and then play some games on the computer.
- Did some beat saber. Twas fun.

* October 8th, 2023
- Just took the dog for a walk. Thanksgiving last night was fun. This morning spent $530 at Walmart lmao, on a bunch of random stuff (for halloween, the house, groceries, lots of shit).
- It's now 2:30, and want to figure out what I'm doing the rest of the day. I think Will is coming over tonight with Danny and Leo for some hot tub time.
- Think I'll watch the meditation modules. Maybe play some games this afternoon.
- Watching the next video which is the science of meditation. It's interesting. The main thing meditation seems to act on is the reticular activating formation. That's what deals with cortisol. So by meditating, you learn to bring that down. And that's what causes meditation to have a positive effect on so many things, because cortisol is the stress horomone. And when you're under the influence of cortisol, your mind is essentially always primed for something bad to happen. That means you sleep lighter, you're more distractable, etc. Because cortisol is supposed to keep you alert to danger. But that's not what you want all the time, if there isn't actually any real danger. And cortisol is a body wide horomone (all horomones are), it's not localized to the brain. So that's why meditation can have an effect on things like the immune system (since it essentially makes your immune system more active and on high alert). Cortisol will worsen auto-immune diseases. Meditation seems to reduce the intensity of those conditions (studies point to this).
  - Meditation helps calm down the sympathetic nervous system, which is the fight/flight system. Parasympathetic nervous system is the one that's more about chill and relax bro, gotta digest. There are techniques that can stimulate the PNS (such as alternating nostril breathing). Left nostril can stimulate PNS, right nostril can stimulate SNS.
  - Also, many times people can have a war going on between their limbic system and frontal lobes. That is their limbic system is saying "hey, things are bad right now bro" while their frontal lobe is looking at the problem logically and saying "no actually, everything is fine". Meditation can help bring those into harmony. Studies show that the frontal lobe is given more and more power over the limbic system. It doesn't eliminate emotions, it just lets you deal with them better.
  - Other thing is that clinical data shows that people who meditate develop more empathy. Not really sure why yet, but we have data pointing that way.
  - Meditating for awhile seems to give people more control over their association cortices. That is, we can stop seeing meaning in benign places. That is we're less likely to think that someone not texting us right away means they hate us.
- I'm really impressed with these videos so far. Figure I'll pick up the ADHD package next.
- I think I want to go lie down for a bit. Just lay in bed and chill.

* October 7th, 2023
- Thanksgiving at Will's today. Need to drop off the used Nespresso pods at the mall. Hopefully make it to the AV place downtown too. Otherwise, mostly cleaning per usual. I need to install that towel rack in the master bath, and then clear off the island of all the crap.
- Well, visited K&W Audio today. Need to email Geoff, the guy we met, but looks like they should be able to help us out. He showed us two of their rooms, one cheaper, and one all out. The all out system was something like $120K. And yea, was pretty impressive, but the delta from that vs something cheaper isn't probably worth it. Anyways, they'll do an in-home consultation for like $150 (which would come off the final bill for whatever we buy from them). They don't stock Polk stuff and he seemed a bit "meh" on them, but that's not surprising considering the range that Polk offers. They stock pretty much every receiver though. Our room seems to be a good size though, even with the rack in place. The two projectors he showed me were both laser. One was an Epson for like $6K, which must be the one that competes with the Sony I was looking at. Then on the higher end he showed me a JVC one which is the second from the top of the line, and it was $20K. I guess the $6K price range will offer 4K, except the imaging chip is 1080p, and to offer 4K the image is essentially overdriven. Like, it runs at 120fps, and then alters the image a bit to introduce the other pixels kind of like interlacing. Whereas if go above $10K you'll get a native 4K chip (which could probably be driven at 8K for the same reason as the cheaper model). Either way, both of them were really nice to look at. I think I could tell the difference on the higher end model, but you're essentially grasping at straws I think. Unfortunately, they didn't have a game console or anything there to try, so hard to tell if one performs better on games (or even how good games look on them). But he said if we need to decide, we can bring one in and try it out.
  - Alright, followed up.
  - Yea, looks like JVC's ranges are $35K, $21K, $13K, and $9K. So we saw one of the $21K models, but we might come in more like $13K.
  - As far as furniture goes, home theater specific furniture is rather expensive, but after talking with Sarah, we'll probably end up going with Ikea (maybe even what Will has). While recliners are nice, we think we'd rather have like a huge couch that you can lie flat on. Sort of like having a couch that is a full chaise the whole way. And apparently that's what Sarah's pinterest inspiration all looks like. So that would be a lot cheaper. Otherwise, he suggests getting an area rug to deal with sound (makes sense). And so most of the price I think will come down to speakers, AV receiver, projector, and labour I guess. Considering this is essentially the last big purchases we'll be making, I think we'll be good. Some of the speakers he was recommending would be less than the Polks anyways. So I'm expecting we'll come in well under $50K. Maybe $30K?
  - Ah, was wondering what the difference between the Reference and Procision models were at JVC, and apparently they are the same, it's just cases lol.
  - So the difference between the $21K and $13K models is essentially brightness from the looks of it. And higher contrast ratio. And I guess the more expensive one has 4 direction shifting for 8K rather than 2. But like... 8K isn't meaningful anyways.
  - Oh wtf, you can get 3D glasses lol.
  - I wonder how much screens cost though.
- Cleared off the island, looks much better. Also finally installed the towel rack in the master bathroom. Should take the dog for a walk. It's so nice outside! 22c, and it's supposed to be like 24c tomorrow and Monday.

* October 6th, 2023
- Gotta take the dog to daycare. Thinking I'll pick up Tims on the way back.
  - It's chilly this morning, noticed frost on the ground.
- Will came over and chilled in the hot tub yesterday. Good shit. Liza picked him up and we told her we're expecting. She looked pretty shocked, but was very happy.
- So today I should reach out to specialized spa directly to see what's going on lmao. Also, need to fill out the intake forms for the therapist.
- Well the Fleshlight order shipped. It's not in the Canada Post system yet, so no idea when it'll get here. Sometime next week is my guess.
- I'm actually pretty excited to build this new NAS. 7950X is a good choice too, since it's cheaper than the X3D, and it's similar performance for productivity workloads. Long term, more excited about an EPYC build, but that's a way out.
- Ah the Rosewill case with hot-swap drive bays is in stock again from the looks of it. I wonder how many drives I should buy? I figure I'll move the drive currently in Hyperion into it. I forget how big that one is though... 18TB? Ah 16TB.
  - Apparently Exos drives are better than Ironwolf Pro in that they are essentially the same hardware, but cheaper. Though apparently the Exos drives are really loud? Not a concern for me though. And that tracks, the Exos drives are a bit cheaper than the Ironwolf Pro drives on Newegg. Only $10 difference on 18TB drives, but like $50 on the 20TB drives.
  - Looks like the 18TB and 20TB drives are the exact same price per TB, the 16TB ones are a bit more expensive actually. So may as well invest in the 20TB ones.
  - Oh man, drive prices came up. Must be due to exchange rate. The 16TB drive I bought in May was $340, the Exos 16TB are $410 right now.
  - Hmm, actually good deals on the serverpartdeals. Refurb Exos X18s are like $230 Canadian, shipping probably extra, and maybe import duty. Still a fair bit cheaper. They're the same part number as the one's on Newegg, just recertified. I wonder what recertified means in practice (manufacturer recertified at that). But that's like a 2 for 1 deal. 5 year warranty on new, vs 2 year on recertified. So 3 year warranty difference. Might be still worth it though.
  - Lol, for like $2300 I could buy 10 drives. That's 180TB lmao.
- Realistically, I think if I build this server, it'll eventually become the LLM machine, since we'll dedicate its PCIe lanes to the GPUs.
  - On the ProArt, the third PCIe is only 2x. I think HBAs are typically 8x apparently.
- Remember to reach out to home builder with quote from roofers.
- Daniel sent me some good resources about HBAs. From my brief look at this: https://forums.unraid.net/topic/41340-satasas-controllers-tested-real-world-max-throughput-during-parity-check/ I think I should aim for a LSI 9300-8i PCIe gen3 x8. That gives  8 x 565MB/s at gen3 x8, 8 x 425MB/s at gen3 x4, and 8 x 380MB/s at PCIe gen2 x8 (4000MB/s). Since I'd only get gen4 x2 on the ProArt, that'd probably be 8 x 200 something on gen3 x2 speeds. And that's totally reasonable since that's about as fast as hard drives will go anyways. An equivalent card to that goes from a reputable seller for about $250 canadian. https://www.ebay.ca/itm/165691994538?epid=1256537908&hash=item26940331aa:g:8AgAAOSwgYde6nkf So, that's probably what I'll get.
  - https://www.ebay.ca/sch/i.html?_dkr=1&iconV2Request=true&_blrs=recall_filtering&_ssn=theartofserver&store_cat=0&store_name=theartofserver&_oac=1&_nkw=lsi%209300
- For recertified drives, the 18TB ones are definitely cheaper per TB.
- Okay, Linus says Meta Quest Pro controllers are WAY better than Quest 2 controllers for Beat Saber. And he raves about the lenses. So maybe I'll end up getting the Pro Controllers at some point. We'll have to see how the Plus ones are.
- Okay, emailed the builders. Now for specialized spas. Okay done. Now to fill out the forms for the therapist. Damn it. Just got an auto response from specialized spas, Michelle is out until the 20th and says to email Jeff.
- Fuck. I think I need Word and Excel.
- Ok, filled out forms.
- Fleshlight order on Canada Post now says Friday the 13th, except they haven't received the package yet, so it says it might update.
  - Hmmmm, the Universal Launch is only $260. I might consider that actually.
- I asked Daniel about the OCR system he uses for scanning. He says he uses this: https://github.com/paperless-ngx/paperless-ngx And then unraid just has like an FTP server plugin I guess. So you have this watch a folder for new PDFs and it'll just pull them in and runs OCR on them. You can even have it do things automatically based on words it finds.
- Alright. So the next thing I should do is the stuff for PS. Then, probably keep on the emacs config (in particular set up the README.org).
- Ok, did a bunch of work on the ticket for PS. Rest should be pretty straightforward. Will finish that off on Tuesday I guess.
- Sarah has to go to the Registry to register her car, then she has to go to the pharmacy to buy some prenatal vitamins, then to pick up the dog. Thinking I'll masturbate.
- Now to do some emacs work!
  - Ok, turns out there's a beginning of visual line and end of visual line command. Didn't know that! It was a little annoying when I'd go "end of line" on this machine and it'd jump to the end of the actual line.
  - What next? I think it's setting up the various programming packages. Especially Lisps.
- Coolio. Got emacs lisp config in. Next will need to do Common Lisp. Then need to set up the README.org
- Time to actually watch the meditation modules.
  - Dhyana is the state of mind that people talk about when they have a good meditation session. Except you can't "do it". Dharana is what you do to achieve Dhyana.
  - Hmm, he says that people think that your mind wandering is a bad thing when meditating, but it's actually a good thing. Since every time your mind wanders and you bring it back is like a pushup. You're strengthening that muscle. So if you feel like your mind is constantly wandering, but you keep bringing it back, you're actually like a person who's doing a ton of pushups.
  - Hmm, that's probably why meditating is a good treatment for ADHD. You're learning to come back to a specific place.
  - Samadhi is a temporary state of enlightenment. It's another thing we talk about as meditation. Samadhi is a state of consciousness that grows out of dhyana. It's like REM sleep as compared to general sleep.
  - Lol, mindfulness is like French food. It's well-known and respected worldwide, but there are so many other varieties of cuisine that are as equally good. Same thing with meditation techniques.
  - Explosion of mindfulness comes from research. Essentially was the most studied in the west I guess. So, they were really interested in meditation, but there were a bunch of different techniques, which made it hard to study the effects. Mindfulness is essentially a distillation of various techniques by removing specific elements. It's like a common ground.
    - Something's lost in the process though. Like, in science, we can look at food as a bunch of carbs. But by focusing on carbs, you lose the flavour.
  - Different types of Yoga. Raja is one that Dr. K. follows, and within that is Asana which is what we think of as "yoga" in the west (that is, physical postures).
  - I think I get it now. All of these different types of yoga are based on temperament. So some people need to do physical postures, some people have a religious temperament (so they do bhakti), others are philosophically minded (brute forcing as he calls it).
  - Raja yoga is a systematic way of achieving enlightenment. That's for people who are super organized by temperament (Will would be this).
  - Buddhism is grounded in Raja yoga. (Yoga came first). Buddhism has three primary branches: theravada (adhere to the original teachings of the buddha the most), mahayana (believe that there are many buddhas, zen came out of this, and then mindfulness came out of zen), and vajrayana is buddhism that rediscovered stuff from tantra (and it's different from hindu tantra because of it).
  - There are other hybrid traditions.
    - Hatha yoga is focused on asana and pranayama (perfecting your body and mind to attain enlightenment).
    - Kundalini yoga is popular recently. It's essentially where all of the discourse on the 7 chakras come from. You focus on purifying the chakras to achieve enlightenment.
    - Kriya yoga is another more recent one. Goal is similar to hatha in that it's about purifying, but it's more about the mind and consciousness rather than the body.
  - The point of going over all of this is to see what's a path that appeals to you. Are you a mystic? Do you care about your body? Are you intellectually inclined?
  - The exploratory videos on various meditations are there to help give a taste of which paths might be right for you.
  - Interesting. Next video is 27min. I might be able to watch this when working out. But I'd probably need to pause it. I need to login on the iPad though.
- I missed the feeling of a shaved dick. So nice to just hold.
- So there are after-market GPU waterblocks for 3090s. There's a site that seems to have a bunch based on the specific boards from the looks of it. Some even seem to be AIOs.
- Might be good to get the ADHD modules too actually, since he says therapy is the best for treating ADHD (the effects last for 2 years if they just stop).
- Okay, well I think I've found out how vibes work for me. First thing is that I think I've had the wrong expectation with them. Second is that I just haven't played with them enough alone. I got the wand out and used it in conjunction with the Tenuto. And yea. Good shit. The Tenuto is good for more... relaxing almost? Because it's not on my head. But if I have it on, and then just sort of caress myself, it's really enjoyable.

* October 5th, 2023
- One week until Mom, Reid, and Ursula are here!
- Ok, so hot tub filters need to be cleaned monthly, with a drain and refill every 6 months (so March I guess? that's probably doable, will get a solid warm day then).
  - Might need to add foam away, since it has been foaming up a bit.
  - Some blog says that with an Ozonator, you should maintain at 0.5ppm for chlorine rather than 1-3ppm (in part because it actually breaks up chlorinated contaminants).
- I've got that call with a therapist at 11:30, then a massage at 4:15, and then Sarah'll want me to pick up the dog. So pretty packed day. I just took my ADHD meds 30min ago (I've actually found myself forgetting to take them recently). So maybe time for some beat saber? Then I think maybe watching this meditation course from Dr. K. This afternoon need to do PS work.
- Fuck, the last thing I want to do is do work for PS... but take a look anyways my dude. It'll be fine.
  - Well that was the simplest fucking ticket in the world. Next one doesn't seem so bad either. But I'll do that this afternoon.
  - Also submitted my time off for next Friday and the following Monday (for when my family is here).
  - And did my quarterly review (which was really quick actually).
- I need to do something fun with Lisp again. I think I should pick up PAIP again (especially the constraint stuff).
- I think the main thing I want to bring over from this emacs config is 1) the recent buffers command, it's just nicer, and 2) a lot of the short cuts. Otherwise, I do like how Nano has everything spaced out.
- You know, I actually do write a lot. But I'm not sure what people would want to read. But maybe that's not really an issue? Just write what makes sense.
  - Actually, I think my concern is more that it feels weird to mix contexts. It'd be a weird set of audiences.
- Alright, had my intro call with Dan, and booked my first session on Tuesday at 2pm. Hmm, I hope there isn't something Sarah wants me to do then...
- As part of this emacs config, I'd like to set up a convention about where Projects go, and then make it easy to create projects from templates.
- Good article on Unicode: https://tonsky.me/blog/unicode/
  - Author agrees that Swift is the only programming language that gets it right, and so we should copy it.
  - Also points out that the specification for things is provided in machine readable format.
  - Annoyingly, Unicode can change which code points represent a grapheme cluster from version to version. So really, you should support each one as a separate (albeit similar) encoding.
  - HN comment gave this as a counter to extended grapheme clusters being the length unit: https://hsivonen.fi/string-length/
  - Really, the issue is that "length" or "count" is an overloaded term. There are many different lengths based on the view of the encoding. Is it length in bytes? Is it length in code units? Is it length in code points? Is it length in extended grapheme clusters?
  - All of this to say. The idea of even a "character" data type is flawed. There are only bytes, and views of bytes. And it should be called Text (not String, which implies a run of characters).
  - One thing I learned though is that the actual rendering of Unicode is locale dependent. Because apparently Hungarian and Russian share code points that render entirely differently. But it's also good to know, since locale is necessary for things like case (upper and lower case are language dependent).
  - By creating a high-level idea of Text, we can also change the underlying representation (for example, using ropes).
- You know. I might be able to get a prescription renewal in Kitchener (or somewhere else in SWO), because I'll probably be in town around then anyways. I think my prescription was supposed to renew on Sep 18, 3 months out is December 18-ish. If I got that, then I'd be good through getting a new doctor. Plus I'll have extras now that I haven't been taking them on weekends (not to mention all of the boosters I have).
- Hmm, the Switch version of the 8Bitdo Arcade stick is like $60 cheaper, and otherwise the same? The Xbox one has a headset port, which I give no shits about. But the Switch one also has bluetooth in addition to the 2.4Ghz module, but the Xbox one doesn't... I think I'll get the Switch one then since it'll look similar to the keyboard that I want to get.
  - That and the whole point of them is that you can replace the buttons and stick with better ones, so the colour scheme matters less too. People say you can upgrade the Switch one with better buttons and still come out less than the Xbox one. Decision made I guess.
  - I still kind of want to get both versions of the keyboard though lmao.
- I wish you could explore memory as a graph in CL. Like, okay, what's the memory layout of this thing? What are these pointers to? What is their layout?
- My shoulders are looking pretty dope. I've noticed them in the mirror. Arms need work. Could do pull-ups too actually... err chinups I mean. Huh, apparently they activate the same muscle groups, just with a slightly different emphasis. Pullups more shoulders and back, chinups more pects and biceps. So yea, should do both. They'll help each other.
- I should check Save-on-foods for Diet Coke after my massage.
  - Should also take my dead batteries into Best Buy.
- I should also reach out to Specialized Spas main email address instead of Jeff since he seems to have gone AWOL.
- So I was curious about serving Skybox VR videos. Turns out that it supports UPnP and DLNA servers, from like Synology NAS. So don't need to use their specific client. Which is good. Means I can move my porn to the NAS lol.
- I think I'll do the meditation course tonight. I really want to do some work right now actually.
- In particular, think I want to work on the emacs config some more. Since if I get that in a good place, then I can move that to this machine which I'll likely use more for my personal stuff anyways.
- Ok, most of the emacs structure is set up I believe. Just need to try it out. And from there, start tweaking things (also bringing in the configuration for various modes).
- Huh, there's a Fleshlight air drying accessory. Which I think I need to be honest. Oddly, it's $10 cheaper when you buy from Fleshjack (the gay site), although to get free shipping, you need an order of $125. So then I added the Sleeve Warmer (which people seem to like), but then you're $0.10 off of free shipping from Fleshjack. Dumb. So I'll order from the normal Fleshlight store. But now I'm thinking I'll get one of the Alien Fleshlights, which are apparently really good...
- Ok, config is good I think. Just need to set up the modes.
- Ah cool, so the emacs reference cards are in the repository under etc/refcards. They're just a bunch of tex files.

* October 4th, 2023
- Eww, gotta do stand up. Yuck!
- Sad thing is... I should do some work today :/ Especially with Monday off as a holiday.
- I need to talk to local lawyers about the cohab agreement, Sarah needs to as well.
- I should look at buying some Power Macs!
- Sittin on the toilet thinking bout generating HTML in Lisp lmao.
- Moved the subwoofer from under the desk to the side of the room.
  - Ok I think I understand what people mean by dual sub being better than single sub. It's not about being louder, it's about evening out dead zones. With the sub off in the corner, it definitely feels "offside".
  - Thinking I'll go SVS SB-1000 Pros for the subs. L800s for the fronts. Still need a center channel. Figure we might move the in-ceiling ones back a bit, and then add atmos as well?
  - Do I upgrade the bookshelfs in my office? Maybe bigger sub?
  - Should get new speaker stands for the bonus room.
- Having kids makes me realize we're not going to have enough space lmao. Need an even bigger house. Need more money.
- I think now that I've planned out my stuff for Rembrandt a bit, I should plan out my own personal stuff. Yesterday I tweeted about how I wished calendars didn't have minute level resolution. Like I just want three categories: things to do in the morning, things to do in the afternoon, and things to do in the evening. I'm not sure the best way to handle this.
  - Something that occurred to me is that I don't really use my iPad for much. I could feasibly mount it to the wall as a calendar (and could always get a new M2 one lmao, especially since the case is disintegrating on my old one and I can't really find a replacement).
    - Oh, interesting: https://www.simplidock.com/
    - They have one for mine: https://www.simplidock.com/products/simplidock-for-ipad-12_9-gen-3-4?variant=39331109372096
    - That would be cool. Not sure where I'd put it though. Maybe by the door like a calendar?
    - I should clear my iPad, it doesn't have enough room for the OS update, but I'm pretty sure that's because of that weird thing that happened where it lost track of 30GB of files...
    - Oh, actually having it in the bedroom would be really cool. Especially since it doubles as a control panel for home kit.
    - The latest update allows you to add widgets to the lock screen. Not a bad idea.
  - See, the thing with calendar stuff like this is that it should really feed into a personal assistant. Like I need to be able to ask, what's on the docket for today?
  - I think a lot of this could be predicated on building out stuff in emacs (especially learning org-mode). That's a double wammy since I can learn to do that stuff for Rembrandt, and then add my own as time goes on.
  - Especially since once I build out a NAS, it'll house essentially LLM services, and can record everything.
  - What's also funny about this is that calendars and schedules is something I have a lot of experience with lmao. I kind of want a daily planner that doesn't give a shit about time. I want three "periods": Morning, Afternoon, Evening. And I should have tasks that cascade between them.
- I'm actually rather excited by work for Rembrandt and my own stuff again, and it's clear to me that I really want to get out of PS.
- I wonder what's the best way to handle todos and shit with Org-mode. I just kind of want a place to plop them down.
- It'd be nice to generate a cheatsheet like the emacs one except with our own keyboard bindings.
- Well, I can't (or rather shouldn't) keep my tasks on this emacs since its org-mode keybindings are all customized. I should do that on Oblivion, also gives me a reason to push everything on it up to the new repository. Yea, think I'll do that today.
- Time for some VR, then I'll come back and work on Oblivion a bit.
  - Lol, most of my stuff for the Quest 3 comes on Friday the 13th, but then the Quest 3 itself (and the charging dock) come on the 16th.
  - Oh interesting, the new Meta sunglasses are only $400ish, which is about the same price as an actual pair of Raybans. Worth picking up I'd think.
  - Hmm, might be worth getting the Touch Pro controllers. I was wondering what the difference was with the Touch Plus ones that come with the Quest 3, and it looks like the Pros have inside out tracking, so the controllers can track themselves rather than relying on the headset. And that might make a difference for Beat Sabre where I find it misses things on occasion.
  - Gonna try out the weighted vest with it, maybe do some Pistol Whip.
- Hmm, plate carrier needs to be hand washed. So should wear a shirt with it.
  - Damn, that does make it a lot harder. I started with Pistol Whip (which was a good idea), it essentially turns into a squat workout. If I were doing just it, I'd do more weight in the vest. But after a level or two of that I moved to beat saber, and holy shit. Yea. You don't feel it so much in the legs or anything, but because it's resting on my shoulders, my shoulders start to give out faster (probably doesn't help that I did upper body last night). It kind of worked out though since by the end, my shoulders were sore due to the vest, and I ended up being in a more neutral position so I wasn't reaching as much with my swings. Better posture. And I did rather well anyways (apart from like the last song when I was really running out of steam). I aced Hey Look Ma I Made It on expert! Either way, I hit my move target for calories pretty quickly, but I actually had to force myself to go to finish the full 30min move target. I got to 25min and was like "I'm done", but seeing 5min left I did another song, and yea. Good workout. I'm also feeling my abs a lot right now, which I don't do a lot of on my upper body day, so it must be from this specific workout. Pretty good overall.
- I've prepared the food for lunch. Just need to grill. But I've got 40min or so until I do that. Time to take a stab at emacs.
- Okay, well I've pulled the config in and pushed it up. I need to create the README.org, but at the same time, I think we need to think through how the config should work a bit. Might be worth looking at some other config bases for examples.
  - Nano provides most of its stuff as packages, which might not be a bad idea. Only thing is that it means updating it is a bit different than just pulling a repo.
  - It'd be nice to just have a repo that you can pull, and then it's all there. But if that's the case, you need to put personal files in a different location.
  - Like, it'd be nice to just have an init.el that already does most of the work.
  - We could also use a gitignore setup where it excludes EVERYTHING except the init.el, the README.org, and the remacs directory which houses the actual stuff.
  - Ah, prelude seems to be an emacs.d config. Might follow that then.
  - Okay, yea, probably will just put everything in remacs folder.
- Having fun putting this config together. I'm crimping a lot from prelude, it's a decent structure.
- Watching a video on meditation by Dr. K. Pretty sure I've watched it before, but he's talking about how there are a bunch of different types of meditation. The reason being that everyone has a special cognitive fingerprint, so instead of trying to practice a meditation technique until it works, you're better off trying a bunch of different ones until you find one that just works for you.
  - Everyone's mind is different, so everyone is going to have a different set of techniques that work best for you. Like this should be obvious, but apparently nobody really talks about it. Like when you're working out, some people have different builds making certain exercise regimes work better for them (sort of like how apparently I have a power lifter physique). Same shit for your mind.
  - There are 112 techniques! One should work super well for you, you just kinda gotta find it.
  - This wiki page (Dr. K) says to see benefits from meditation, you need to do about 8-10 weeks, 3-5 days per week, for 20min at a time. I'd thought 15min, but 20min is similar. I can do that. Only thing is... which meditation?
- I need to send the statement to Mark today. I should automate that somehow...
- Alright, back from walking the dog.
  - Was thinking on the walk how I should add to the FAQ or processes for Rembrandt: "When should you use Emacs Lisp vs Common Lisp?" Essentially, Emacs Lisp is for anything that would be used exclusively by engineeers at their computer. If at any point you could foresee running it on a server, then you use Common Lisp.
- You know, I think I'm sticking with PS out of a fear of losing my salary. I've spent so long being dependent on an income stream, that that part of me is still there yelling "you can't leave your job, what will you do without it?" And at the same time, I'm getting excited about what's happening in my own life again as well as even Rembrandt (as it's currently aligned with my interests). On the other hand, I cannot get excited about PS, I think in large part due to a lot of negative experiences that suggest that they don't give a flying fuck about me, so why should I give a flying fuck about them? That they didn't address our salaries last year, and then had the gall to give me the meagerest of bumps this year is at the root of why I can't bring myself to work for them. Why would I help someone who I feel has deeply insulted me. And that's probably down stream of the insult I felt during the sale with the investors. It interesting, because I don't think I'd ever really felt insulted in that way before.
  - With the investors, and Aaron in particular, I just could not believe that they'd tell me with a straight face that what they were proposing was a good deal for us. It was so blatantly screwing us over, that the fact that they were sugar coating it (in the smallest possible way), it made it clear that they thought we were idiots. And yet the only reason we were having a sale at that time was because we'd built a fucking business that was worth that much to a public company. Everything we projected came true in the end too. I was just stunned. It felt like a huge betrayal. Not that we'd ever been close, but all of their words prior to that were "we just want to help you build your business, and we're here to help" and then come out and fucking stab us in the back like that? Unbelievable.
  - And so now at PowerSchool, I know that I have no future there anyways. Everything they've done suggests that they don't want me there, so why try and blow smoke up my ass to do stuff that's meaningless in the end? I feel no attachment to the people working there, and the fact that even Will is fast-tracking his way out is a sign to abandon ship. Subconsciously I'm already there. Instead I just keep feeling guilty about drawing a salary. But honestly, fuck them.
  - And I'm going to keep drawing a salary from them because I feel like they owe me for how they insulted me at the beginning of this year.
  - Like bro. My financial projections through this year put me at like $40K in my CHEQUING account. I barely have any expenses otherwise. And that's not even counting the $35K I have coming in from the indemnity escrow. That's like a third of my salary!
  - Meanwhile, if I took my income to 0, I wouldn't run out of money in my chequing account until sometime in 2025. That's without including investments!
    - So long as Mark keeps paying me interest, that even covers my Property Taxes.
  - If I work with Will and put a bunch in the market, I could end up earning more than I am now (and tax advantaged at that), without even considering SaaS income from it.
  - So if I give them like 5-6 months notice (or just keep doing essentially nothing until they decide to fire me), then that gives me another $60K pre-tax.
  - And watching my bank balance dwindle will probably do more to encourage me to make money. If Rembrandt doesn't go anywhere, I can always get another job after all.
- Lol, the builders reached out to their roofers and they confirmed that the vents should have screens. So I've emailed them back "what're the next steps then?"
- God I love black licorice.
- I definitely feel like I need to start a meditation practice every day. Just need to figure out what to start with.
- Something else I was thinking about last night (I think it was last night at least) was that I need to learn more new things. I need to be a noob again. I stick with all of my same interests, which is fine and all, but if I'm not learning something new, I've in effect given up on living. This is something Will's really good at.
  - Like, what are my other interests that I'm not pursuing? Drawing, model trains, hardware, writing? Guitar, music generally?
  - Oh that might have been it. It was an episode of the big bang theory where Sheldon had an ear worm that he couldn't place, and the thought ran through my head that I've never gotten the hang of identifying musical notes by ear. Like I can't name them, and that's probably part of the reason why I capped out at guitar. I was never able to symbolize the music.
  - I think part of the reason this has been on my mind is that the other day I watched another video by Dr. K which was about how shame is supposed to drive us to get better at things, but because of modern society, we can mostly just run away from it. When you feel shame, it's an impetous to get better at the thing. When we lived in tribes, there wasn't anywhere else to go. With the internet, there's an infinite number of places to run away to. His point was that negative emotion, and especially shame, all drive us to learn things.
    - Something else he pointed out was that anger is a signal that your boundaries are being stepped on. Anger is territorial.
- Working for PS is definitely a mental weight I carry around. Every time I'm doing something I enjoy, a part of me feels like I should be doing something at PS instead. It's literally like carrying a weighted vest of guilt. But it's more than just guilt actually. It's the mental weight of having to go on stand up every day, and think about what I'm going to say I'm working on, and then trying to fit that into my schedule for the week somehow. It's all just WEIGHT I'm carrying. And I really have to ask myself, is that worth the money I'm getting?
- I need to speak with a therapist.
- It's a bit annoying that Dr. K is like "there are 112 different types of meditation" but then... where do you find out about them?
- There are a few things I'd like to talk to a therapist about, but the main one would probably be that I generally don't know how to ask people for help. Or even, recognizing when I could be asking someone for help. It's a bit funny, because I know to ask a therapist about this, but I realize this is something that I'm rather different than other people at?
- Alright, emailed one therapist (they're outside of Calgary to the north, so not sure how long it'd take to get there though). Oof, 49min drive.
  - Hmm another one I could talk to tomorrow at 11:30am. Lemme check my calendar. Alright, booked. He'll call me at 11:30.
- Maybe I should buy Dr. K's meditation guide. I mean I've found his videos helpful, why not support him?
- Am I just going ahead with Rembrandt because I want to work with Will? Or is it a sense of feeling left behind if he goes off and does something? What would I actually want to do otherwise?
- Should I try making a game?
- Well Will came over for a bit to chat. I guess he's really feeling overwhelmed? Maybe not the word. Let's just say work is on his mind.
- I shaved my dick and balls after my walk. Feels interesting holding it now lol. It's been awhile.
- Great news! I'm still rich! Andrew hasn't invested my USD yet, so I haven't been fucked by the market.
- Good self-pleasuring session.
- I think my problem with Cyfer was it was a bit too open ended. So I didn't have a good place to start with it. Realistically, I think I was on an okay path with content-addressable storage, and a notation (both binary and textual). But I think I was being a bit too perfectionistic. I wonder how to address that. The other thing is that by making it "the project", I'd feel bad if things didn't fit right. But really, maybe I should be working on it as tooling for something more fun? Then, by working on the fun thing, Cyfer is just a side effect. Like, a programming language is interesting to me, but it's hard to showcase, and it's hard to show progress. I need something more visual.
- I bought the meditation module from Dr. K. Looks pretty cool actually. It's interesting because it's structured as like a skill tree lmao.

* October 3rd, 2023
- Well the sex toys sure are effective lmao.
- I really like the new speedos too. 36 was the right call for sizing, they fit great.
- Meeting with Will and then immediately after is the meeting with Ameer around fund.
- Then we have a roofer coming at 9:30 to check out the bathroom fans.
- A Ryzen system would be decent for a NAS actually, similar to how Daniel has a 12400K or something like that in his. EPYC would be more for Rembrandt stuff (and that would be a capital expense).
  - Would I do a Ryzen X3D again?
  - I can see if there's one with 3 PCIe 16x slots.
  - The ProArt has 3, but one of them is only 2x. And so if you want 2 video cards, you only have one slot for an HBA. I suppose you could swap one of the cards out for another HBA at some point. The board has 4 SATA ports built in. HBAs are usually 8 I think? So I mean 1 might work if we just go with a 12 drive case (which I think is how many the hot swappable one has).
  - Huh, can't seem to buy Rosewill hot swap case anymore, seems out of stock? Oh, you can buy it at Rosewill.
  - Can't really do more than 3 GPUs per system. 4U seems to max out at 7 PCIe slots. So you need two slot cards...
  - Might need to figure out an after market cooling system for 3090s. There exists one dual slot 3090 and it goes for like $2000 on ebay lol.
  - Eh, could just go dual 3090s and fuck it.
- It'd be nice to have a system that transcribes audio, then pumps it into an LLM which suggests questions I can ask.
- Okie dokie. Just waiting on the roofer now. Then I can do whatever I guess.
- Followed up with Jeff now too.
- Man I want a Fractal North, I just wish it came in full tower.
- I should take some steaks out.
- At the meeting with Will and Daniel, it was decided that I'll probably have to handle downloading all of the data from thetadata. That means I need to come up with a strategy for pulling it (in a somewhat randomized fashion so it looks a bit less like we're just pulling everything all at once).
  - From this we'll need to figure out what format we want it in. For the purposes of just pulling it, we could just save it as like JSON or CSV or something, with the goal of packing it at a later time.
- Alright, roofers got here. Turns out there are dampers on the fans, but he says there are screens that've been removed (which is odd). Those screens would be removed if the outlets were for a dryer (to stop catching lint), but it doesn't make sense to have those removed for bathroom fans, and apparently all of them have been removed. So he'll send me a quote, but he says to reach out to the home builder since it might be covered under warranty.
  - Alright emailed the home builders.
  - Time for some VR! Then maybe taking bubs to her grooming appointment.
- Alright, so did my VR workout. Good shit.
- I think as far as NAS goes, that'll be a "order on the Amex on the 13th" sort of deal. I should put together a parts list. I can get an HBA whenever, so may as well ask Daniel about it and then see how long it takes to get here. I think the ProArt mobo with a 7950 (non-3D V-Cache one) is the best bet since it has two nics one of which is 10G. The similar "pro" model from ASRock only has a 1G and 2.5G nic, and no thunderbolt 4.
  - It also helps that I have one already, so I'm familiar with the motherboard BIOS. Doesn't really matter if it's ECC or not, we'll save that for the EPYC build.
  - The 7950X also has its own internal graphics which is fine for now, I'll add 3090s in it at a similar time I guess.
  - It's kind of funny that that will be my salary for the month lmao. I can build a rad computer each month with my surplus salary.
  - Hmm, the memory costs a bit more. I think it must be pegged to USD. But yea, we'll kit this fucker out with 192GB.
  - I might need to grab a switch too. I can probably unplug another one from the gateway, but it might be nice to get a switch on there now. Maybe one with 2.5G?
  - We can put this one directly on tailscale, and then give Daniel access to it as well if he wants to fuck around with LLMs or StableDiffusion on dual-3090s.
  - I'm still curious if I can get the 128GB working on Hyperion.
  - In the meantime though, I think I'll stick to using Nebula for my tests. I'm gonna need to add it to tailscale though. I wonder how that'll work.
- I think yea, figuring out tailscale on Guix is a good first step.
- ChatGPT gives the following names for computers (got rid of 2 that were meh):
  - Aegis
  - Zenith
  - Orion
  - Quasar
  - Seraph
  - Phoenix (not sure about this one)
  - Elysium (or this one)
  - Arcadia
- I might actually rename Nebula to one of those. I've never been super happy with Nebula. Actually, Ethereal was suggested and it might be good for the laptop since it kind of is Ethereal (once it goes to sleep, you can't wake it over LAN).
- Aegis would definitely work for one of the servers.
- I think I'll get an Enterprise 24 PoE switch since it's only about $100 more than the Professional 24 PoE and it has 12 2.5G ports and 12 1G ports rather than just 24 1G ports.
- I think I need to create my own Guix channel for these random services.
- Hmm, the tailscale instructions for NixOS mention setting up nameservers, which makes sense, not sure how that works with Guix.
- Man, I really wish I had a huge carpet mat. They don't seem to make really big ones though, and two side by side just doesn't work well.
  - This black one is 90cm x 120cm. So 3'x4'.
  - The largest one Staples sells is 60" x 118", which is 5x10'
  - Damn that'd be huge actually. It'd go well past my desk end.
  - My desk is 200 by 175, so 7' by 6' (rounding up). I wonder if I can find something like that. 84 x 72".
  - 4x5 might be enough too.
  - Oh, there's a 48" x 79" one at Staples. That's 4 by 6.5-7ish. That actually might work out really well.
    - https://www.staples.ca/products/253238-en-floortex-polycarbonate-lowmedium-pile-carpet-chair-mat-48-x-79
    - I think I'll order this on the next CC cycle as well.
  - The reason I'm thinking about this is because it's kind of a pain in the ass to work on Nebula at the moment, since my chair will go off the mat.
  - Actually, I should order one of these too (to replace this stupid Ikea one):
    - https://www.structube.com/en_ca/franke-walnut-veneer-filing-cabinet-on-casters-74-99-85?pid=25968
  - I also need like a little shelf or something to organize stuff on my work bench.
- All things considered I don't mind this chair so far. Obviously pretty cheap, but not bad. I might order one of the leather ones and see how that goes. I'm not really sure if I'd want a herman miller one anyways.
- Something I need to set aside time to read. Get inspired.
- I've mounted the two power bricks (for the LG monitor and the CalDigit) to the back of the desk. Just need to cable manage a bit now. A bit annoying that the brick for Nebula is so big (same for the Samsung G9 monitor).
  - The power bar on this desk is holding really well, the one on the work bench starts leaning. I think I need to put some other form of tape along the middle to hold it up. Guess I should buy some duct tape.
- I also need a place to put my supplements and meds. Maybe on the shelf? Especially if I move some of the PC stuff onto the workbench.
- For the ProArt, M.2 slot 3 shares bandwidth with the PCIe 16x slot at the bottom of the board, so if there's an HBA in there, the M.2 will be limited to PCIe 4 2x bandwidth (4GB/s rather than 8GB/s). So not worth getting a high speed drive for that one.
  - Oh cool the BIOS manual seems to suggest that you can configure SATA ports as hot-pluggable.
  - There's QVL support for Kingston 4x32GB kits that run at 5600MHz. Wait... it's not supported for 4? That's odd. Why would they include a 4 DIMM kit and then only rate it for 2 DIMMs... Still, the 4x48GB kit is rated for 4 DIMMs.
- Hey hey, my license is here!
- I should look up how to get rid of shredded paper. 1) I wonder if I can just pour them in the bin, and 2) it used to be annoying using bags, but I remembered that I have those large blue stretchy ones which should be good.
  - Okay yea use the clear stretchy bags.
- Interesting, Python has lists and tuples. Lists are square brackets and tuples are round brackets. Otherwise, tuples are immutable while lists are mutable. This maps somewhat to syntax for Cyfer maybe? Round brackets means syntax (which is immutable), whereas square brackets are list literals. Syntax quote is essentially a tuple builder form.
- I should get some KN95 masks for when I'm changing the litter. Don't want to be huffing kitty shit.
- Man, I need help with planning I think.
- Okay, so I've added a Projects and Tasks template to a new "Technology" team space, and I've started adding tasks to the Setup Tailscale project. I think I should add some more projects, and then break those down into tasks as well.
  - So there's a project needing done for setting up tailscale (which I've been thinking on), but Will also asked me to take charge of the Data Ingress project from thetadata.
  - Another project we need to undertake is understanding MMAP, CFFI, and SBCL's SIMD intrinsics. This seems harder to break down. Needs thought.
  - Oh, another project is the emacs config.
- Feeling good about having the projects listed out and breaking out some of the tasks. Shared that with Will and Daniel.
- I think it's time to walk the dog, then when I come back maybe start taking a look at Nebula and getting a sense for where everything is on it. (Perhaps set up the Guix channel).
- I feel like I should keep my own personal tasks too. Not sure where. (Maybe in Org-mode eventually?)
- It'll be cool to work on an emacs config with Daniel.
- Alright, back from walking the dog. Still need to do some lifting today, but all upper body stuff. Time for a snack though.
- Hmm, thinking I'll pick one of these up as well: https://grovemade.com/product/wood-desk-shelf/?initial=342
  - Not for the main desk, but for the workbench. They have trays you can get too for loose things like chap stick and what have you. And yea, I should put all of that shit somewhere. I think it'll make sense to just keep my meds and stuff on that work bench no this little shelf.
- Aww yaaa. Worked out. Feeling great.
  - Was watching a video on meditation by Dr. K. It was titled "I Meditated, Now I Don't Care Anymore". The original poster talks about how after meditating for so long, he just doesn't seem to care about things anymore in the sense that he feels content no matter what. And so he doesn't know what to do with his life now that he's content doing anything. And Dr. K talks about how that means that he's now at the point where he can just live life. He's dealt with his desires and is no longer attached to them, so he gets to CHOOSE what he does now without just acting out his desires. What's his karma?
  - Made me realize that I should start meditating. And like, that's a recurring thought, but I don't do it. Why?
  - I think it might be a sense of feeling like a waste of time, but it's actually an answer to that feeling!!
  - Another thing I was thinking about while working out (which I wrote in my phone) is that I feel like I have a bunch of things I want to do in the day, but really, it's not about doing all of those things during A day. It's that those are things that are top of mind for me. And so I've confused "things I've prioritized" with "things I need to do today". And I think this stems from some sense of lack of control over what I do. So I keep things on my mind and go "you have to do this, you have to do this, you have to do this" and I see them as urgent, when really I'm just afraid of forgetting about them. But why am I holding on to them so tightly? Who cares if I don't do them?
  - I mean, addressing this I'm sure is a two part thing. On the one hand, I need to start meditating, not for long, but get in the habit. The second is that if I do have things I want to prioritize, I should SCHEDULE them. Doesn't have to be all in one day, or try and cram so many things into a day, but I can schedule them through the week. I think I did a better job of this when I had Google Calendar with work. It sometimes feels like ever since moving to PS, I'm juggling multiple calendars and that just doesn't work for me. I think there's an aspect of making it legible too. Having things in the calendar is good, but it's no good if I don't actually look at it or follow it.
  - I think part of the issue I have with calendars too is that they aren't good about having slack in them. They expect you to add things by the minute rather than broadly as "this afternoon", "this morning". And I don't like that that's the case.
- Well Sarah's on the phone with her sister, lord knows when she'll be done. Better go drill in those screws to the hot tub.
  - I think she's done.
- Well, I'm an idiot. I thought the hot tub keys were like part of the mechanism for the locks, but no, they were in fact the keys. All good now though. Although one of the straps ended up off centre. :/ I could undo it and add some caulking or something to fill the hole, but whatever. I also added all of the screw caps to the cover arm. I actually had to undo them all a bit since the caps go around the screw head, and most of them were screwed all the way in. The caps need a bit of a lip to grab on to so that they don't just pop off. The point of the caps is to 1) hide them (since they're silver and the rest of the assembly is black), and 2) protect them from the elements I think. So all good. It's a bit annoying that the cover went on a bit off-side. Nothing lines up perfectly which annoys me.
- Thinking I'll do ramen for dinner tonight. Once hot dogs have been opened, kinda gotta eat em fast.

* October 2nd, 2023
- Well, the sex toys might go out for delivery today. They're apparently listed as at the local carrier hub.
- I wonder if the electrician is ever gonna get back to me lol.
- Well, upgraded SLR to premium again for a year, they had a good deal. Figure I'll get some use out of it with the new headset, and I'll download a lot for long term storage.
- Alright, spoke with Daniel. Was telling him about how you can't find Epyc 4th gen anywhere, but he found it at atic.com! Which is where he bought the ECC memory for his build. Good to know! Also it's interesting looking at those chips because there are a lot of options around $6K for instance, but the difference between them is like "do you want an absurd amount of cores? or do you want high frequency?" and there'll be like 3 options along those axes. So like 112-cores, 96-cores, or 48-cores.
- And the sex toys are out for delivery!
- Today I have to go to the ultrasound appointment with Sarah at 2:30ish I think. Then we'll grab groceries on the way back.
  - A bit of an annoying time since that's when I'd be doing work...
- I think I'm gonna upgrade the RAM in Nebula. Then I should start fucking around with emacs some more on Intel MBP.
- Will sent me this article about OpenAI and how they're essentially doing a weird options-strategy with their equity. And reading it was like, mhmm, mhmm, I've seen these words before... but so much of it went over my head. I really need to get to understand options better.
- Maybe today then apart from the stuff with emacs and Nebula should revolve around actually planning what I'm gonna do.
- I took my Vyvanse today. So no weed tonight. I think this is a good setup. By taking THC earlier in the day, I end up processing most of it before I go to bed, so I still get lots of REM. I remember dreaming last night, but I forget what they were about.
- Something else I need to do is register the warranties for the mattresses and also the hot tub (I need to screw in the clips for the cover as well).
- And it works! 62.2GB of RAM being reported (obviously less the amount set aside for the integrated GPU). Good shit. I wonder if it has an effect on performance.
  - Thing is, I wonder if I should install Windows on it for shits and giggles. Not really a reason to? But I have the second disk drive set aside for games and I've done nothing with it (it's not even in the system config to be mounted).
- Okay yea, I think this idea of doing weed on the weekends and then vyvanse on the weekdays is a good decision. Like I'm really feeling the vyvanse right now (since this has been like the first tolerance break I've had in some time).
  - Another reason was that I was really enjoying the weed on the weekend afternoons. I'd take a dip in the hot tub and just relax. And then I'd go and wrap myself in blankets for awhile, rinse and repeat. It was really enjoyable.
  - Now I want to WORK.
- Hmm fractional scaling definitely doesn't work on the 4K with GNOME. Maybe that needs wayland?
  - Oh wait, that was on Wayland.
  - Turns out you need to enable some setting at the command line (it works): https://www.debugpoint.com/fractional-scaling-fedora/
  - It is wayland only though.
  - The fans on Nebula are GOING.
  - Something's going on. One of the cores is 100% pegged. Device is at 64c.
    - Might be related to time apparently. You can't actually seem to change the timezone within GNOME, but I suppose that makes sense in that it's configured in the system.scm.
    - But may as well do a full update. It's been over a month.
- Fedex is outside...
  - Oh! It's our toilet seats. Reminds me I should follow up with Jeff this afternoon.
- It occurs to me that maybe trying to build a window manager/desktop environment with Wayland and Common Lisp is a good use of my time. Specifically because it'd give me a good opportunity to use CFFI.
- I need like a little shelf or something for the big desk. It's a really good workbench for electronics (the huge deskpad was a good choice). I'm thinking of keeping the iFixit and LTT screwdriver on it.
- So the RAM has been upgraded. What did I want to do otherwise? Oh, let's set up the warranties.
- I wonder what software there is for streaming music from a NAS.
- Oh apparently you don't need to register Casper anymore. Just keep the proof of purchase.
- I need to plan my NAS. I think it'll be another BIG computer. Probably good to aim for smaller core count but higher frequency. The main reason we'd be going for EPYC is just for RAM and PCIe after all. As far as PCIe, we'd be looking at filling it with 3090s and HBAs.
- I'm wondering if it'd make sense to clear this Mac and have it set up with Nix the same way the Intel one is (at least, after I can back everything up to the NAS).
  - Part of the reason being that I'd like to be able to set up VMs on this machine using libvirt but I'm not sure why it's not working.
- Occurred to me that I could use Steam Link on the Apple TV. Was also looking at Moonlight clients, and apparently there is one. Would be interesting to try.
- So in terms of tasks that need to be done. Big one with MMAP is making sure that I can get SBCL to generate code that writes specific integer sizes to memory in as few instructions as possible.
  - Right, so my main goals here are to get used to how SBCL generates low level code ideally.
  - I think I also have a task of just getting back up to speed with programming. Maybe that means going through some of the CL books again to get inspired. Like going through PAIP. That would be good in that it'd get me in the mood to generate a language front-end for our domain.
  - On the other side of things, I really need to study options. I feel like involving ChatGPT would be good here.
  - There's also a bit of "I should learn stats!". And again, not sure what the best way to go about that would be.
- I wonder if I'm on a slow Guix server. It only seems to download at like 200KB/s. Hmm, it varies a lot. Weird.
  - This is the kind of thing where, does there even need to be a centralized server for this? It seems like a mesh network a la bittorrent would be perfect for this shit.
- Hmm, I wonder how good the code is that SBCL generates for ironclad.
  - That reminds me, a good experiment for CFFI would be Blake3 (or even other crypto libraries for that matter).
- It's interesting that git needs LFS for large files.
  - Oh, I think it has to do with the interplay between large files and diffs. That is, commands take a long time if it's diffing huge files where the name doesn't change but the content does. When really it doesn't make sense to diff them at all, so LFS just stores a link to a content addressable file I guess, in effect putting it out of band.
  - Reason this came up is that I guess Hugging Face is just git repos, but they use LFS to deal with the models themselves. (I want to download Mistral is why).
- It's really dumb that anthropic doesn't seem to give access to Canadians.
  - Okay, I think Nebula is building a new kernel.
  - Or maybe not actually. Not sure what it's doing.
  - Ok well I had to force shut it down and when I rebooted it had a new kernel version, so I guess it worked.
  - And the time is now correct and Shepherd isn't consuming a whole CPU's capacity.
- Ok cool. Think Nebula is good.
  - Good news is that I can actually try the SIMD package on it. It's not AVX512, but it is AVX2.
  - Hmm, I don't think I have tailscale installed on it.
    - I'd have to create a tailscale service I guess.
- Need to figure out this weighted vest and take the dog for a walk with it.
  - Doesn't really say which way is front... I think it's the one with more places for patches.
  - Okay I think I have it right.
  - I feel like you could totally fit two plates in each. Would be a bit snug, but that's fine.
  - Lol, I could totally wear this in VR and it'd be a solid workout.
- Sex toys are here! And my speedos are out for delivery.
- Ok, so verdict on the weighted vests: holy shit. I just did 10lbs total on my normal 30min walk and damn. What a workout. It's a good way to recognize that being fat must SUCK. Everything is harder.
  - I can totally use this for the rest of my body weight exercises simply to make them more difficult. (Like pushups and pullups in particular).
  - Like I said earlier, this would be good for VR too. In particular it'd make the shooting games more difficult because there's a lot more crouching and springing back up which would definitely be harder with a vest on.
- When I'm at walmart I should pick up a flat or two of diet coke. There's so much space in the pantry we can just keep them on the floor by the freezer.
- I think I need to assign names to my macs to make them easier to distinguish. It's annoying that they sometime's trample on each other's host name. But how do I name them???
  - Oblivion would be a good name.
  - Star Strider
  - Prophet
  - I like this train of thought. I think Oblivion would be good for the Intel Mac, and Prophet for the M1 Max.
- Alright renamed the machines. Now I'm gonna upgrade them to the latest OS (may as well since I'm gonna be out of the house shortly).
- I still need to find a therapist.
- One thing I need to figure out how to bring over from this emacs config to the other one is the fact that recent files shows files I had open on my last session (like I just reopened emacs and I could use Cmd-o to load 2023-october without having to navigate to its location).
- I suppose there's no harm in booking a phone appointment with Dr. Pengelly to ask about prescription given I'm still on OHIP and I won't have a doctor until at least January. Not to mention that there's that legislation about fulfilling prescriptions for narcotics across provinical borders.
- I need to buy corn starch at Walmart (and insert holes in the film instead of opening it fully, so that I can use it as a shaker).
- I think I'll order those 8Bitdo keyboards on the next CC cycle (which would be the 13th for the Amex I think).
- Back from the appointment and grocery shopping. I got progressively angrier as time went on and I'm not sure why. Why have I been feeling so angry and short tempered lately?
- Sonoma upgrade is complete.
- I think in spite of knowing about the appointment at 2:30, I feel a bit of resentment that it was at the time that I consider my main working hours. So now I'm back, and the day is essentially done.
- I think the fact that Sarah constantly puts dishes in the sink when the dishwasher is dirty and has tonnes of room in it REALLY pisses me off. Because I keep telling her to just put them in the dishwasher, and every time she gives an excuse about things needing to soak, but she keeps doing it and it means that I'm constantly putting her dishes away whenever I need to use the sink. Not to mention she'll leave cans in there and they'll rust leaving rings in the sink that are fucking impossible to get out. And of course, because she puts them into the sink she says she'll do it later, but LATER NEVER HAPPENS because I end up putting them away.
- I think I was feeling frustrated because this is the first time in awhile where I was in the mood to work (thanks to the medication), but then wasn't able to because I had the prospect of my entire afternoon being set aside for something else, so it felt like a waste and makes me feel like a failure.
  - Then on top of that, I think I started to feel overwhelmed by traffic because we ended up getting out around rush hour. So there was constant waiting in lines at the checkout, the fucking Sobey's checkout is stupid, then more traffic. And to top it all off, I couldn't buy diet coke because THERE WAS NO DIET COKE ANYWHERE. And then at walmart I'm pretty sure I ended up buying an extra bag of chips because it scanned it twice or something...
- I should go work out. Leg day so just dead lifts, squats, and ab roller. Short and sweet.
- I'm still probably being too hard on myself with respect to work. I have a good day, it doesn't go exactly as how I planned, and then I feel like it was a waste. But that's not true.
- At least my speedos are out for delivery and I should get them before I'd usually go to the hot tub.
